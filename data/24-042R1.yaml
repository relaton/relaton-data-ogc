abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 20 GIMI Open-Source Report documents the results of the
    OGC Testbed 20 work performed to evaluate and enhance open source libraries and
    tools in support of the GEOINT Imagery Media for ISR (GIMI) format.\r\n\r\nThe
    GIMI format has the potential to grow and gain popularity by building upon existing
    open source software. Recent integration work, particularly with libheif, aims
    to align with the GIMI profile and enhance architectural robustness. The libheif
    library provides the capability to decode and generate all conformant still-image
    HEIF/AVIF files, including High Dynamic Range (HDR), and uses the color transformation
    matrices specified in the color profile. The High-Efficiency Image File Format
    (HEIF) is a digital container format for storing individual digital images and
    image sequences."
