abstract:
- content: "The scope of this discussion paper is to investigate types of Point of
    Interest (POI) data in indoor space and propose a conceptual model to harmonize
    the POI information with the IndoorGML core and navigation modules. In particular,
    this document focuses on the management of spatial (and non-spatial) history of
    indoor POI features. The paper covers the following scope:\r\n\r\nPoints of Interest
    Feature Types;\r\n\r\nA Conceptual model to extend IndoorGML schema for indoor
    POI; and\r\n\r\nUse cases in home navigation and hospital facility management."
