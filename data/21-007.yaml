abstract:
- content: "This document provides a profile for JPEG 2000 for use as a\r\ncompression
    format for raster imagery. JPEG 2000 uses\r\ndiscrete wavelet transform (DWT)
    for compressing raster data,\r\nas opposed to the JPEG standard, which uses discrete
    cosine\r\ntransform (DCT). It is a compression technology which is best\r\nsuited
    for continuous raster data, such as satellite imagery and\r\naerial photography.
    This version adds support for\r\nReferenceable imagery."
