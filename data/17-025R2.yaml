abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report (ER) has been produced in conjunction with two
    other engineering reports from the OGC Testbed 13, the Abstract Data Quality ER
    [4] and the Data Quality Specification ER [5] to capture status quo, discussions,
    and results in the context of requirements for data quality assessment for Quality
    of Service in the Aviation Domain. It will, in particular, provide a Data Quality
    Assessment Service Specification. Much of the ER is presented in the future tense,
    using terms such as 'shall', in order to express requirements and constraints
    on future Data Quality Assessment Service implementations. The service specification
    includes design patterns, extension mechanisms, and service interface considerations.\r\n\r\nIn
    recent years, the concept of data quality has generated a notable interest among
    System Wide Information Management (SWIM) [17] implementers, both organization-specific
    and global. In the context of SWIM — and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) implementations
    in general — data quality pertains to two major use cases, service advertising
    and service validation:\r\n\r\nService advertising\r\na service makes known to
    a potential consumer the quality of the data provided by the service. Based on
    this information, the consumer can determine whether or not the service meets
    its needs.\r\n\r\nService validation\r\nassurance is given that the quality of
    the data provided by a service is consistent with the quality that is explicitly
    defined in a service contract or any kind of agreement that may exist between
    a service provider and service consumer.\r\n\r\nBoth use cases share two common
    preconditions:\r\n\r\nAn unambiguous definition of the concept of data quality
    exists.\r\n\r\nA set of measurable parameters that allow specifying data quality
    is defined.\r\n\r\nThese are tasks that were performed as part of Testbed 13.
    The findings of the tasks are documented in the Abstract Data Quality ER (FA001)[4]
    and the Data Quality Specification ER (FA002)[5]."
