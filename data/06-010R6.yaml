abstract:
- content: "*THIS STANDARD HAS BEEN RETIRED* \r\n\r\nThe OpenGISÂ® Transducer Markup
    Language Encoding Standard (TML) is an application and presentation layer communication
    protocol for exchanging live streaming or archived data to (i.e. control data)
    and/or sensor data from any sensor system. A sensor system can be one or more
    sensors, receivers, actuators, transmitters, and processes. A TML client can be
    capable of handling any TML enabled sensor system without prior knowledge of that
    system.\r\n \r\nThe protocol contains descriptions of both the sensor data and
    the sensor system itself. It is scalable, consistent, unambiguous, and usable
    with any sensor system incorporating any number sensors and actuators. It supports
    the precise spatial and temporal alignment of each data element. It also supports
    the registration, discovery and understanding of sensor systems and data, enabling
    users to ignore irrelevant data. It can adapt to highly dynamic and distributed
    environments in distributed net-centric operations.\r\n \r\nThe sensor system
    descriptions use common models and metadata and they describe the physical and
    semantic relationships of components, thus enabling sensor fusion.\r\n\r\nThis
    is one of the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) [http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/markets-technologies/swe]
    suite of standards.\r\n"
