abstract:
- content: This OGC Testbed 18 Engineering Report describes the Data Model and API
    of a Key Management Service (KMS) that supports the flexible but secure exchange
    of cryptographic keys for applying confidentiality and integrity protection to
    geographic information. The described KMS is based on the design and implementation
    from previous OGC Testbeds 16 and 17.
