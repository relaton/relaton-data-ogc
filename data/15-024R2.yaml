abstract:
- content: This document is a deliverable of the OGC Testbed 11 . It describes the
    results of developing a tool to automatically derive Schematron code from SBVR
    constraints. It also documents a vocabulary with a profile of core geospatial
    terms and concepts, which can be used to express geospatial constraints in business
    rules.
