abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report was prepared as a deliverable for OGC Testbed
    10, an initiative of the OGC Interoperability Program. The document presents the
    work completed with respect to the Cross Community Interoperability (CCI) thread
    within the testbed. The work has been commissioned in order to inform geospatial
    information frameworks of the Defence Geospatial Information Working Group (DGIWG),
    National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG) of the US National Geospatial
    Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD).\r\nThe Engineering
    Report presents an analysis and assessment of interoperability between DGIWG,
    NSG and UK MOD profiles of Web Map Service (WMS) and Web Feature Service (WFS)
    standards of the OGC. The engineering report also presents findings from the implementation
    of the reference profiles.\r\n"
