abstract:
- content: "The OGC Catalogue Services 2.0 specification (OGC 07-006r1) establishes
    a general framework for implementing catalogue services that can be applied to
    meet the needs of stakeholders in a wide variety of domains.\r\nThe ebRIM application
    profile (OGC 07-110r4) is based on the HTTP protocol binding described in Clause
    10 of the Catalogue 2.0 specification; it qualifies as a ‘Class 2’ profile under
    the terms of ISO 19106 since it includes extensions permitted within the context
    of the base specifications, some of which are not part of the ISO 19100 series
    of geomatics standards. The ebRIM application profile also includes a Basic extension
    package (OGC 07-144r4) of the OASIS ebXML Registry Information Model (ebRIM) providing
    artefacts of general utility in the geomatics domain.\r\nThis document provides
    an extension package aligned with the ebRIM application profile of CS-W for the
    cataloguing of ISO 19115, ISO19115-2 and ISO 19119 compliant metadata. It was
    initially produced during the ESA HMA (Heterogeneous Missions Accessibility) initiative
    [HMA] and related projects. Some input came from the OGC OWS9 initiative.\r\nThis
    document supersedes the former document OGC Cataloguing of ISO Metadata (CIM)
    using the ebRIM profile of CS-W, OGC 07-038r3 (Version: 0.1.12).\r\n"
