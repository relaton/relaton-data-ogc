abstract:
- content: "The geospatial community has had an on-going challenge with being able
    to share data and compute resources in dynamic, collaborative environments that
    span different administrative domains. For these types of requirements, the concept
    of federation has been developed. The near-term goal of the Federated Cloud task
    in Testbed-14 is to demonstrate a specific data-sharing scenario among two or
    more administrative domains using existing security tooling, e.g., OpenID Connect
    and OAuth. The main details of this work are reported as part of the Security
    Engineering Report (ER) [1]. This Federated Cloud ER will dovetail with the Security
    ER to:\r\n\r\nCoordinate across all federation-related tasks in Testbed-14, including
    the Earth Observation Cloud and Workflow tasks,\r\n\r\nUnderstand the overall
    federation design space,\r\n\r\nAnalyze and critique the scope, trade-offs and
    limitations of the federation capabilities being built and demonstrated in Testbed-14,\r\n\r\nIdentify
    and prioritize possible incremental development tasks for subsequent testbeds,
    and\r\n\r\nLiaison with groups external to OGC, such as the NIST/IEEE Joint WG
    on Federated Cloud, to promote the further development and adoption of federated
    capabilities, and ultimately international standards."
