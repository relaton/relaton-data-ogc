abstract:
- content: "This document specifies how a Web Coverage Service (WCS) offers multi-dimensional
    cov-erage data for access over the Internet. This document specifies a core set
    of requirements that a WCS implementation must fulfil. WCS extension standards
    add further functionality to this core; some of these are required in addition
    to the core to obtain a complete implementa-tion. This document indicates which
    extensions, at a minimum, need to be considered in ad-dition to this core to allow
    for a complete WCS implementation.\r\nThis core does not prescribe support for
    any particular coverage encoding format. This also holds for GML as a coverage
    delivery format: while GML constitutes the canonical format for the definition
    of WCS, it is not required by this core that a concrete instance of a WCS service
    implements the GML coverage format. WCS extensions specifying use of data encod-ing
    formats in the context of WCS are designed in a way that the GML coverage information
    contents specified in this core is consistent with the contents of an encoded
    coverage.\r\n"
