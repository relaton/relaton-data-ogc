abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 17 Engineering Report (ER) documents the work completed
    in the “Attracting Developers: Lowering the entry hurdle for OGC Web API experiments”
    task.\r\n\r\nOGC Web API Standards are being developed to make it easy to provide
    geospatial data over the web. These standards provide a certain level of formality
    to ensure high levels of interoperability. They rigorously define requirements
    and rules to reduce room for error during interpretation. This rigor sometimes
    makes the standard documents difficult to read and hence implement. Rather than
    direct examination of a standard, the majority of developers often prefer to start
    with implementation guidelines, sample code, and best practice documentation and
    then refer to the standards document for guidance and clarity.\r\n\r\nThe Testbed-17
    (TB-17) API task served as a foundation for further development and exploration
    and delivers knowledge necessary for agile development, deployment, and executing
    OGC Standards-based applications following a “How-To” philosophy with hands-on
    experiments, examples, and instructions.\r\n\r\n"
