abstract:
- content: "The OpenGIS® Open Location Services Interface Standard (OpenLS) specifies
    interfaces that enable companies in the Location Based Services (LBS) value chain
    to “hook up” and provide their pieces of applications such as emergency response
    (E-911, for example), personal navigator, traffic information service, proximity
    service, location recall, mobile field service, travel directions, restaurant
    finder, corporate asset locator, concierge, routing, vector map portrayal and
    interaction, friend finder, and geography voice-graphics. These applications are
    enabled by interfaces that implement OpenLS services such as a Directory Service,
    Gateway Service, Geocoder Service, Presentation (Map Portrayal) Service and others.\r\n"
