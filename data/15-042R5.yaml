abstract:
- content: TimeseriesML 1.2 defines an XML encoding that implements the OGC Timeseries
    Profile of Observations and Measurements, with the intent of allowing the exchange
    of such data sets across information systems. Through the use of existing OGC
    standards, it aims at being an interoperable exchange format that may be re-used
    to address a range of data exchange requirements.
