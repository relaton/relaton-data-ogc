abstract:
- content: "This OGC® document specifies improvements to the processing of information
    represented in or referenced from an application schema in UML to create derived,
    implementation level resources, in particular:\r\n•\tXML Schema documents to represent
    types and their properties\r\n•\tSchematron schema documents to represent constraints\r\n•\tXSLT-Stylesheets
    to create KML instances of features\r\nThe documented improvements have been specified,
    implemented in the ShapeChange tool and tested in the context of schemas developed
    as part of the NGA's Topographic Data Store (TDS) schemas.\r\nThe work is a continuation
    of the work documented in OGC® document 10-088r2, the OWS-7 Schema Automation
    Engineering Report. \r\n"
