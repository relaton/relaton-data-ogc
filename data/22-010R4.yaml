- content: "This OGC Abstract Specification (AS) defines a general parameterization
    of surface deformation models.\r\n\r\nAll objects on the surface of the Earth
    are moving. Apparently fixed features such as buildings are moving with the Earth’s
    crust, being subject to ongoing plate tectonic movement and episodic deformation
    events such as earthquakes.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly, applications and users rely on
    global positioning methods, such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
    observations, to precisely determine the coordinates of features. The resulting
    coordinates are then stored in databases and used in a wide range of applications,
    such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS). However, the coordinates from GNSS
    are referenced to global reference frames and coordinate reference systems (CRSs).
    In these reference frames the coordinates of apparently fixed objects are continually
    changing.\r\n\r\nThis creates a challenge for the geospatial and positioning community:
    How to account for this movement when comparing data sets observed at different
    times, or how to locate an object observed in the past.\r\n\r\nThis problem is
    generally addressed in one of two ways:\r\n\r\nDefining a reference epoch for
    the CRS of coordinates held in the GIS, often by defining a CRS with a reference
    epoch, or\r\nUsing a CRS which is fixed relative to the surface of the Earth.\r\nIn
    practice there is little difference between these two approaches. Neither the
    position at a reference epoch, nor the coordinates in a static CRS, can be directly
    measured by global positioning methods.\r\n\r\nPropagating the observed coordinates
    to a reference epoch, or transforming to a static CRS, requires a deformation
    model — a mathematical model of the deformation of the Earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nCommon
    uses of a deformation model include:\r\n\r\nDetermining the current location of
    an object based on historic measurement of its location,\r\nPropagation of the
    current observed location of an object to the reference epoch of a static CRS,\r\nDetermining
    the spatial relationship of data sets observed at different times, and\r\nPredicting
    the location of an object at some future time.\r\nCurrently, many national geodetic
    agencies have developed or are planning to develop regional deformation models.
    However, the current models generally use customized formats and software developed
    by each agency.\r\n\r\nThis AS describes a way of parameterizing a deformation
    model such that it can be encoded into a data set and used in software for coordinate
    operations. The AS defines how to calculate the displacement of a point between
    two different epochs. It provides a common understanding between producers of
    deformation models and developers of software about what the deformation is and
    how it will be used.\r\n\r\nThis AS will allow users of compliant software applying
    a compliant deformation model to be confident that the model is being used as
    intended by its producers."
