abstract:
- content: "The GeoPackage Extension for Tiled Gridded Coverage Data‚Äù (TGCE) extension
    (previously titled Elevation Extension) defines how to encode and store tiled
    regular gridded data, such as a digital elevation model, in a GeoPackage. The
    tiles contain values, such as elevation, temperature or pressure, and the extension
    defines two encodings. The PNG encoding uses PNG files to store 16-bit integer
    values and a scale and offset may be applied to fine-tune the coverage range.
    To support 32-bit floating point data or binary data, the extension also defines
    a TIFF encoding. In this encoding, TIFF files are used to store IEEE floating
    point or a binary data type where the SampleFormat has a value of either 1 (unsigned
    integer) or 2 (signed integer) AND the BitsPerSample is either 8, 16, or 32. To
    simplify development, this encoding constrains many of the TIFF options to the
    minimal set needed to meet the floating-point requirement. The extension also
    defines two ancillary data tables: one for regular gridded coverages and one for
    tiles.\r\n\r\n"
