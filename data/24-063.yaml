abstract:
- content: "The Metadata Code Sprint was planned to have a primary focus on the following
    group of tools, APIs and encodings.\r\n\r\nOGC GeoDCAT – (under development) a
    spatio-temporal profile of the W3C DCAT Recommendation DCAT, and provide guidance
    about its use and further specialization. OGC GeoDCAT is inspired by the GeoDCAT-AP
    specification but defines just the internationally relevant concepts to allow
    wider application. The key areas to consider are around the expression of place
    and time, such as GeoDCAT-AP properties-for-location\r\n\r\nOGC API – Records
    provides a way to browse or search a curated collection of records of geospatial
    resources, known as a catalog. A record makes a resource discoverable by providing
    summary information (e.g. metadata) about the geospatial resource.\r\n\r\nISO
    19115 Standards define the schema required for describing geographic information
    and services by means of metadata. Of particular interest will be recent developments
    on JSON encodings provided by ISO 19115-4.\r\n\r\nSTAC provides a common structure
    for describing and cataloging spatiotemporal assets. A spatiotemporal asset is
    any file that represents information about the earth captured in a certain space
    and time.\r\n\r\nOther metadata standards, such as CDIF, EML, and Local Context
    may be included where the use of these have important implications on the utility
    of geospatial metadata.\r\n\r\nParticular focus will be placed on use of OGC modular
    “building blocks for location” that address both simple and the most complex use-cases."
