abstract:
- content: The Sensor Event Service (SES) provides operations to register sensors
    at the service application and let clients subscribe for observations available
    at the service. The service performs filtering of sensor data (streams) based
    upon the filter criteria defined in these subscriptions. Filters can be applied
    on single observations but also on observation streams, potentially aggregating
    observations into higher-level information (which itself can be regarded as observation
    data). Whenever matches are discovered, a notification is sent to the subscriber,
    using asynchronous, push-based communication mechanisms.
