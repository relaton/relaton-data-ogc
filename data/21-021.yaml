abstract:
- content: Experts agree that access to, sharing, and application of location-enabled
    information is a key component in addressing health related emergencies. While
    the present COVID-19 pandemic has underscored a range of successes in dealing
    with the COVID virus, many gaps in supporting local to global preparedness, forecasting,
    monitoring, and response have been identified when dealing with a health crisis
    at such an unprecedented level. This study considers how a common, standardized
    health geospatial data model, schema, and corresponding spatial data infrastructure
    (SDI) could establish a blueprint to better align the community for early warning,
    response to, and recovery from future health emergencies. Such a data model would
    help to improve support for critical functions and use cases.
