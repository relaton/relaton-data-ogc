abstract:
- content: "This paper does four things. Firstly, it describes the benefits of representing
    geospatial data using semantics, graph, and web technologies. Secondly, it gives
    an overview of the current capabilities of the GeoSPARQL standard, showing that
    many benefits of semantic and graph technologies are already within reach. Thirdly,
    it outlines some shortcomings of the existing GeoSPARQL implementation specification
    that, if addressed, would unlock its potential to a greater extent, and could
    significantly increase its user base. Finally, it identifies other related activities
    that are current at the time of editing this paper. In doing so, it establishes
    liaisonâ€™s between the different activities in an attempt to achieve alignment.\r\n\r\nThe
    purpose of this paper is to provoke further thought about a best course for further
    development of the GeoSPARQL standard, and to invite active involvement in that
    development. Particularly, the involvement of people and organizations that until
    now have not been able to put GeoSPARQL to good use, either because of perceived
    limitations or because of unfamiliarity with the standard, will be highly valued.
    Also, since one development under consideration is to make provisions for use
    of GeoSPARQL with non-geographic spatial data, those that see opportunities for
    using spatial data in a broad sense together with the aforementioned technologies
    are cordially invited to share their views."
