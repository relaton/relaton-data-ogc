abstract:
- content: This document presents the Sensor Interface Descriptor (SID) schema that
    enables the declarative description of sensor interfaces, including the definition
    of the communication protocol, sensor commands, processing steps and metadata
    association. This schema is designed as a profile and extension of SensorML. Based
    on this schema, SID interpreters can be implemented, independently of particular
    sensor technology, which are able to translate between sensor protocol and SWE
    protocols. They establish the connection to a sensor and are able to communicate
    with it by using the sensor protocol definition of the SID. SID instances for
    particular sensor types can be reused in different scenarios and can be shared
    among user communities. The ability of an SID interpreter to connect sensors and
    Sensor Web services in an ad hoc manner based on the sensorâ€™s SID instance is
    a next step towards realizing sensor plug & play within the Sensor Web.
