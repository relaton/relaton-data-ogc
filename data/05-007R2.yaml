abstract:
- content: "A Web Service Processing Service provides access to calculations or models
    which operate on spatially referenced data.  The data required by the service
    can be available locally, or delivered across a network using data exchange standards
    such as Geography Markup Language (GML) or Geolinked Data Access Service (GDAS).
    \ The calculation can be as simple as subtracting one set of spatially referenced
    numbers from another (e.g. determining the difference in influenza cases between
    two different seasons), or as complicated as a global climate change model. \r\n
    \r\nThis specification is intended to provide a mechanism to identify the spatially-referenced
    data required by the calculation, initiate the calculation, and manage the output
    from the calculation so that it can be accessed by the client.  The Web Processing
    Service is targeted at both vector and raster data based processing. \r\n"
