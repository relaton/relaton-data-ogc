abstract:
- content: "This standard defines the version 3.0 of a geospatial extension to the
    OASIS eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) Version 3.0 standard.
    It thereby enables the interoperable definition of access rights / constraints
    using the XACML 3.0 language, processing model and policy schema but extends the
    ability to phrase conditions on geographic characteristics of subjects, resources
    and objects. \r\nIn that sense, a GeoXACML policy could restrict access to geospatial
    information, e.g. provided by OGC Web Services. However, a GeoXACML policy could
    also restrict access to non geospatial assets by stating restrictions for access
    based on the location of the user (or the mobile device used) trying to access
    the protected assets. Therefore, this standard applies to main stream IT.\r\nFor
    enabling processing of access control decisions based on geometry, Geospatial
    eXensible Access Control Markup Language (GeoXACML) 3.0 Core inherits by normative
    reference ISO 19125 which defines a geometry model and functions on geometry instances
    which enrich the XACML 3.0 specification. \r\n"
