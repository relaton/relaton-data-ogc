- content: "The concepts of agile architecture and reference architecture may not
    be new ideas in information or geospatial technologies, but what is meant by the
    term Agile Reference Architecture?\r\n\r\nAgile Reference Architecture is the
    long-term vision of the complex and changing nature of how problems will be solved
    in the future within the location-referenced and geospatial realms. This includes
    consideration of network availability, as containers integrated with Linked Data,
    and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) serve data as secure, trusted, and
    self-describing resources.\r\n\r\nWhile the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) focuses
    on geospatial information and technologies, that community is also dependent on
    the overall state of information and communications technology (ICT), including
    developing cyber, cryptographic, and internet technologies.\r\n\r\nIn today’s
    infrastructures, the collection, exchange, and continuous processing of geospatial
    resources typically happens at pre-defined network endpoints of a spatial data
    infrastructure. Each participating operator hosts some capability at a network
    endpoint. Whereas some network operator endpoints may provide data access, other
    endpoints provide processing functionality and other endpoints may support the
    uploading of capabilities. In other words, such an infrastructure is not agile
    in the sense that it cannot adapt by itself to meet the needs of the moment. One
    of the biggest challenges resulting from the static characteristics is ensuring
    effective and efficient operations of the overall system and at the same time
    maintaining trust and provenance.\r\n\r\nThis OGC Testbed 19 Engineering Report
    (ER) outlines novel concepts for establishing a federated agile infrastructure
    of collaborative trusted systems (FACTS) that is capable of acting autonomously
    to ensure fit-for-purpose cooperation across the entire system. One of the key
    objectives is to not create a new data product, but instead a collaborative object
    is offered leveraging FACTS that allows for obtaining the data product via well-defined
    interfaces and functions provided by the collaborative object.\r\n\r\nTrust and
    assurance are two key aspects when operating a network of collaborative objects
    leveraging STANAG 4774/4778. STANAG 4774 outlines the metadata syntax required
    for a confidentiality label to better facilitate and protect sensitive information
    sharing. In addition, STANAG 4778 defines how a confidentiality label is bound
    to the data throughout its lifecycle and between the sharing parties.The agile
    aspect is achieved by the object’s ability to activate, deactivate, and order
    well-defined capabilities from other objects. These capabilities are encapsulated
    in building blocks. Each building block is well defined in terms of accessibility,
    functionality, and ordering options. This allows building blocks to roam around
    collaborative objects as needed to ensure a well-balanced network load and suitable
    processing power of individual nodes from the network.\r\n\r\nEqually trusted
    partners in the infrastructure participate in FACTS. They can collect data from
    other partners and create derived products via collaborative objects. The sharing
    of data products is only possible directly, meaning direct communication with
    data consumer and it is only possible via the objects. This guarantees that fundamental
    trust operations are applied to the data and provenance records are produced before
    the data product is made available to others. The use of Blockchain technology
    and Smart contracts is one example of how this fundamental behavior can be planted
    into collaborative objects. As in trusted networks that are using Evaluation Assurance
    Level (EAL) approved hardware and software components, the objects will have to
    undergo a similar assurance process.\r\n\r\nFor ensuring the acceptance and interoperability
    of an agile reference architecture, built on top of FACTS with collaborative objects
    and building blocks, standardization is a key aspect. In particular, the core
    (fundamental) requirements for FACTS as well as the interfaces and capabilities
    of the collaborative objects and pluggable building blocks should be standardized.
    The OGC provides a consensus based collaborative standardization environment fits
    these requirements very well."
