abstract:
- content: "AIXM stands today for the de-facto standard for Aeronautical Information
    Publication, used by air control service providers from Europe, USA and Australia.
    With version 5.1, it reaches a level of maturity allowing the support of Digital
    NOTAMs, as the first official version of these messages was published this year.\r\nIn
    a near future, AIXM will be carried inside WFS requests but also into notification
    messages along WS event services. This last channel will be the one dedicated
    to D-NOTAMs. As D-NOTAM is aimed at aircrafts pilots, their transmission to the
    aircraft will use air/ground data link. Today, datalink communications lack bandwidth
    and future datalink will still have a limited capacity.\r\n"
