abstract:
- content: "Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a new approach in using existing standards
    to accelerate distribution and analysis of 2D regular grid coverage data on the
    web. COG combines the use of the TIFF format with data structured internally in
    tiles and low resolutions subfiles (also called overviews). The main subfile is
    georeferenced using GeoTIFF tags and the lower resolution subfiles inherit the
    same georeferencing. This organization allows for retrieving only the part of
    the data needed for presentation or analysis. This capability is possible not
    only in the file system but also over the web if the HTTP range header is supported
    by the servers.\r\n\r\nThis OGC Testbed 17 Engineering Report (ER) discusses the
    COG approach, describes how GeoTIFF is used for the lower resolution subfiles,
    and proposes a different path forward that integrates COG with the OGC Tile Matrix
    Set Standard (http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-083r2/17-083r2.html). The ER
    includes a chapter that formalizes the draft COG specification with clear requirements.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the common use cases for COG is the provision of multispectral remote sensing
    data. The increase in spatial and spectral resolution combined with more accurate
    sensors that require more than 8 bits per pixel results in big files that can
    exceed the 4 Gbyte limit of the original TIFF format. Having an OGC standard formally
    specifying this approach would be useful. Therefore, this ER includes a chapter
    that formalizes a draft BigTIFF specification, defining clear requirements.\r\n\r\nThe
    objective is to be able to reference BigTIFF from the GeoTIFF and the COG standards."
