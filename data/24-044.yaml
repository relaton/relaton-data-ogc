abstract:
- content: "High-Performance Geospatial Computing (HPGC) is crucial for addressing
    the increasing complexity and volume of geospatial data across sectors such as
    meteorology, disaster management, and climate change. While High Performance Computing
    (HPC) offers significant potential, integrating it with geospatial tools remains
    a challenge. The OGC Testbed 20 High-Performance Geospatial Computing Optimized
    Formats Report (this Report) investigates the potential of cloud-optimized formats
    (such as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG), GeoZarr, and GeoParquet) to optimize HPGC
    performance by addressing data transfer bottlenecks and enabling efficient data
    access. By evaluating these formats and exploring data indexing and partitioning
    strategies, the goal is to develop a framework for scalable and efficient HPGC
    workflows. The Testbed found that using Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) in HPC
    environments offers efficient data access and flexible data management, but balancing
    file sizes and read requests can affect performance. GeoZarr provides scalable
    data management and efficient parallel read/write operations, though it generates
    many files that can cause I/O issues in traditional block-storage systems. GeoParquet’s
    columnar layout and multithreading capabilities enhance storage efficiency and
    data retrieval, but the lack of a spatial index and the need to decompress entire
    chunks can complicate data management.\r\n\r\n"
