abstract:
- content: "The OGC Surface Hydrology Features (HY_Features) standard defines a common
    conceptual information model for identification of specific hydrologic features
    independent of their geometric representation and scale. The model describes types
    of surface hydrologic features by defining fundamental relationships among various
    components of the hydrosphere. This includes relationships such as hierarchies
    of catchments, segmentation of rivers and lakes, and the hydrologically determined
    topological connectivity of features such as catchments and waterbodies. The standard
    also defines normative requirements for HY_Features implementation schemas and
    mappings to meet in order to be conformant with the conceptual model.\r\n\r\nThe
    HY_Features model is based on an abstract catchment feature type that can have
    multiple alternate hydrology-specific realizations and geometric representations.
    It supports referencing information about a hydrologic feature across disparate
    information systems or products to help improve data integration within and among
    organizations. The model can be applied to cataloging of observations, model results,
    or other study information involving hydrologic features. The ability to represent
    the same catchment, river, or other hydrologic feature in several ways is critical
    for aggregation of cross-referenced or related features into integrated data sets
    and data products on global, regional, or basin scales."
