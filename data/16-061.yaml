abstract:
- content: This engineering report (ER) is a deliverable of the OGC Testbed 12. It
    advances previous work in the area of business rules for AIXM 5 based on SBVR.
    It evaluates the use of geo-spatial operators and constraints in SBVR, including
    a proof of concept for their automatic interpretation by software. It gives guidelines
    on how to deal with temporality aspects and how to extend the applicability of
    SBVR towards filtering expressions and it identifies limitations of the currently
    available vocabulary.
