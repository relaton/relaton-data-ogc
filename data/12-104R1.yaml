abstract:
- content: This document provides a technical description of the Single Point of Entry
    Global Gazetteer (SPEGG) implemented for the OWS9 test bed.  The SPEGG integrates
    two gazetteers – a copy of the USGS gazetteers containing domestic names (hosted
    by CubeWerx Inc.) and the NGA gazetteer containing foreign names (originally hosted
    at NGA but currently hosted by Intergraph Corp.).  Both integrated gazetteers
    and the SPEGG implement the Web Feature Service (WFS) standard.
