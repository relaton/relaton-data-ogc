abstract:
- content: 'A Sensor Observation Service provides an API for managing deployed sensors
    and retrieving sensor data. Whether from in-situ sensors (e.g., water monitoring)
    or dynamic sensors (e.g., satellite imaging), measurements made from sensor systems
    contribute most of the geospatial data by volume used in geospatial systems today.  '
