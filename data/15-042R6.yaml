abstract:
- content: "TimeseriesML 1.3 defines an XML encoding that implements the OGC Timeseries\r\nProfile
    of Observations and Measurements, with the intent of allowing the exchange of\r\nsuch
    data sets across information systems. Through the use of existing OGC standards,
    it\r\naims at being an interoperable exchange format that may be re-used to address
    a range of\r\ndata exchange requirements."
