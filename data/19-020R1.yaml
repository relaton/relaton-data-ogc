abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed-15 Engineering Report (ER) describes the results of the
    Earth Observation (EO) Process and Application (EOPAD) Task in the Cloud Processing
    and Portrayal (CPP) thread of OGC Testbed-15. The ER presents the data model and
    service interface of the catalogue service allowing for discovery of EO applications
    and related processing services for subsequent deployment and/or invocation in
    a distributed environment.\r\n\r\nThe ER also provides the architectural and implementation
    details of the software components that were developed as part of the activity
    and which interact through the described data model. These software components
    include catalogue clients, catalogue servers and transactional Web Processing
    Service (WPS-T) servers."
