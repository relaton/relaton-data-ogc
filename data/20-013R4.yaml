abstract:
- content: "This document comprises the Engineering Report (ER) and documents the
    activities under Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the OGC Maritime Limits and Boundaries
    (MLB) Pilot.\r\n\r\nThis Engineering Report details the activities undertaken
    by participants in the pilot, the data supplied, transformed, and used to demonstrate
    the pilotâ€™s objectives, and the results of the various interoperability tests
    performed within the pilot. Also documented here are the various outputs from
    the pilot activities, where they are directed, and where updates or clarifications
    are recommended to external standards or other elements of the broader ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe
    ER documents the journey taken within the project, from its origins as an architectural
    statement of intent, through to the definition of its core elements (the GML application
    schema which lends a common language to the data) and the implementation of that
    schema within COTS, open source and bespoke software elements. The engineering
    report also summarizes the outputs from the process, any unresolved issues, and
    potential enhancements for the future."
