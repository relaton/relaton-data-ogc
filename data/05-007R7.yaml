abstract:
- content: 'The OpenGIS® Web Processing Service (WPS) Interface Standard provides
    rules for standardizing how inputs and outputs (requests and responses) for geospatial
    processing services, such as polygon overlay.   The standard also defines how
    a client can request the execution of a process, and how the output from the process
    is handled. It defines an interface that facilitates the publishing of geospatial
    processes and clients’ discovery of and binding to those processes. The data required
    by the WPS can be delivered across a network or they can be available at the server. '
