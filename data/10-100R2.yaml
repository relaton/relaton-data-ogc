abstract:
- content: 'This approved OpenGISÂ® Implementation Standard defines a Simple Features
    profile of the Geography Markup Language version 3.2. This Simple Features Profile
    has been aligned with the OGC Simple Features standard for SQL version 1.2. Simple
    Features include: Point, Curve (LineString), Surface (Polygon), Geometry, MultiPoint,
    MultiCurve, MultiSurface, and MultiGeometry. The detailed abstract model for OGC
    features and geometry can be found in the OGC Abstract Specification, Topic Volume
    1: Features (which is equivalent to ISO 19107).'
