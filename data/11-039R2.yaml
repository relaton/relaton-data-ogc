abstract:
- content: This document describes a conceptual model for the identification of hydrologic
    features independent from geometric representation. This model allows common reference
    to hydrologic features across scientific sub-disciplines in hydrology. The Hydrologic
    Feature Model, HY_Features, is designed as a set of interrelated Application Schemas
    using ISO 19103 Conceptual Schema Language and ISO 19109 General Feature Model.
    It is factored into relatively simple components that can be reviewed, tested
    and extended independently.
