abstract:
- content: The GeoAPI Implementation Standard defines, through the GeoAPI library,
    a Java language application programming interface (API) including a set of types
    and methods which can be used for the manipulation of geographic information structured
    following the specifications adopted by the Technical Committee211 of the International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO) and by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).
    This standard standardizes the informatics contract between the client code which
    manipulates normalized data structures of geographic information based on the
    published API and the library code able both to instantiate and operate on these
    data structures according to the rules required by the published API and by the
    ISO and OGC standards.
