abstract:
- content: "This engineering report describes a protocol for synchronizing data between
    two enterprise servers. While the protocol itself is generic, this engineering
    report describes its application to web feature servers.\r\n\r\nIn the simplest
    terms, the protocol involves each synchronization peer accessing the otherâ€™s Sync
    resource to get the set of changed objects since the last time the Sync resource
    was accessed. In the case of web feature servers, the objects are features. The
    requesting peer then compare that list of changed features with the identically
    identified features in its data store and performs any necessary changes so that
    the feature states match.\r\n\r\nContinuing the work done in Testbed-11, this
    engineering report describes the implementation of a Sync operation in a WFS server
    that:\r\n\r\nEnhances the Sync operation from Testbed-11 to include an abstract
    query element where each service type can then substitute their specific query
    syntax for identifying the specific sub-set of changed features to be synchronized.
    In the case of the WFS, several query syntaxes may be used including the wfs:Query
    element and a REST based feature type URI with query parameters.\r\n\r\nExtends
    the definition of the Sync operation with the addition of a resultType parameter
    to allow a client to obtain a hit count of the number of features that a Sync
    operation shall return.\r\n\r\nShall investigate the proper procedure for handling
    resource references. Implementing the resolvePath parameter alone is not sufficient
    to ensure complete data set synchronization.\r\n\r\nShall investigate concurrency
    and consistency issues."
