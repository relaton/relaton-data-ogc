abstract:
- content: This OGC Engineering Report (ER) documents the findings and experiences
    resulting from Terradue Activities on the OGC Earth Observation Applications Pilot.
    More specifically, this ER provides a way forward for the implementation of the
    applications to the data paradigm in the context of Earth Observation (EO) satellite
    data processing and Cloud-based platforms to facilitate and standardize the access
    to Earth observation data and information.
