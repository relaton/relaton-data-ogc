abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 17 Engineering Report (ER) documents the result of the
    work performed in the CITE thread of the OGC Testbed-17 initiative. CITE is the
    Compliance Interoperability & Testing Evaluation Subcommittee that provides a
    forum for an open, consensus discussion regarding approaches and issues related
    to conformance and interoperability testing as part of the OGC standards process.
    This ER provides information about the development of a test suite for the OGC
    API — Processes Standard (OGC18-062r2) to be executed in the OGC Test Evaluation
    tool (TEAM Engine). The ER also documents an evaluation of an alternative environment
    for OGC compliance testing.\r\n\r\n"
