abstract:
- content: "One of the key objectives of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Climate
    and Disaster Resilience Pilot 2024 (CDRP) is to encourage innovations that can
    achieve scale for emergency management analysis, decision support, and preparedness.
    Multiple and interrelated challenges across sectors impacted by climate change
    can collectively produce a larger negative effect. However, there are a number
    of barriers to achieving cross-sectoral collaboration and analysis \r\nat needed
    scale. In addition to the need for more scientific knowledge, the information
    systems, data, and data management practices used to address these challenges
    are siloed, making it difficult to share knowledge and understand the Cumulative
    Effects (CE) and regional impacts due to varying geography, environments, and
    populations."
