abstract:
- content: "The impact of global climate change has led to a rise in the frequency
    of natural\r\ndisasters in numerous countries resulting in substantial losses
    in terms of both human lives and the global economy. The establishment of a robust
    disaster early-warning mechanism is recommended that will empower communities
    to proactively engage in disaster reduction and prevention measures before such
    calamities occur, thereby effectively reducing losses.\r\nThe Common Alerting
    Protocol (CAP) is an internationally recognized digital\r\nmessage format and
    protocol for all types of alarms and early warning notifications. It was officially
    adopted by The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 2010 for its Integrated
    Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS). It has also been successfully implemented
    in Taiwan for many years. However, different countries may employ other color-coded
    warning systems to indicate varying degrees of disaster severity. This disparity
    in warning standards can cause public confusion during emergencies, leading to
    increased costs in disaster management. This paper proposes a framework that utilizes
    red and yellow warning lights for issuing alerts. Adopting a standardized approach
    will mitigate confusion and enhance the efficiency of disaster response and management.\r\nThis
    study proposes a framework that uses red and yellow warning mechanisms for\r\nissuing
    alerts such as the disaster early warning for debris flows and large-scale\r\nlandslides
    established by the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau (SWCB). This\r\ninvestigation
    will explore the feasibility of standardizing yellow and red warning\r\npublishing
    rules."
