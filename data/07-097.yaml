abstract:
- content: 'This document specifies the Reference Model for the ORCHESTRA Architecture
    (RM-OA). It is an extension of the OGC Reference Model and contains a specification
    framework for the design of geospatial service-oriented architectures and service
    networks. The RM-OA comprises the generic aspects of service-oriented architectures,
    i.e., those aspects that are independent of the risk management domain and thus
    applicable to other application domains. '
