abstract:
- content: The OGC Timeseries Profile of Observations and Measurements is a conceptual
    model for the representation of observations data as timeseries, with the intent
    of enabling the exchange of such data sets across information systems. This standard
    does not define an encoding for the conceptual model; however there is an accompanying
    OGC Standard which defines an XML encoding (OGC TimeseriesML 1.0 - XML Encoding
    of the Timeseries Profile of Observations and Measurements). Other encodings may
    be developed in future.
