abstract:
- content: This OGC Disaster Pilot â€™21 (DP21) Engineering Report summarizes work done
    in the Pilot to increase disaster awareness among a range of disaster management
    stakeholders. Pilot participants implemented components of a data flow ecosystem
    to leverage analysis-ready earth observations and other datasets (ARD) and produce
    decision ready indicators (DRI) according to collaboratively developed workflow
    recipes. DP21 focused on the hazards of flooding, landslides, and pandemic, as
    well as the interactions and complications between them, in three regions including
    the Piura and Rimac river basins in Peru; the Red River Basin in Manitoba, Canada;
    and the greater New Orleans area in Louisiana, United States. The Pilot also prototyped
    providing information to field practitioners in secure geopackage formats, as
    well as leveraging linked data and structured web page information to optimize
    public web searches for disaster information.
