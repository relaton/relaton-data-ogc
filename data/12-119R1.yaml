abstract:
- content: This engineering report represents the results of the OWS-9 innovations
    thread on mobile applications. Initially, the goal was to help understanding the
    requirements for developing standards-based geospatially-enabled mobile applications.
    The report describes how OGC Enabled Mobile Apps can be integrated into information
    architectures based on OGC standards. Particular emphasize has been put on the
    future work section, as it provides valuable recommendations for further standardization
    work (and, equally important, highlights aspects that could be excluded from standardization)
