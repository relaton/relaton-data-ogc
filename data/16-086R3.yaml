abstract:
- content: "This document proposes a set of best practices and guidelines for implementing
    and using the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Map Service (WMS) to serve
    maps which are members of an ensemble of maps, each of which is a valid possible
    alternative for the same time and location. In the meteorological and oceanographic
    communities, it is Best Practice to produce a large number of simultaneous forecasts,
    whether for a short range of hours, a few days, seasonal or climatological predictions.
    These ensembles of forecasts indicate the probability distributions of specific
    outcomes. This document describes how to unambiguously specify an individual member
    of an ensemble, or one of a limited set of map products derived from a full ensemble.
    \r\nIn particular, clarifications and restrictions on the use of WMS are defined
    to allow unambiguous and safe interoperability between clients and servers, in
    the context of expert meteorological and oceanographic usage and non-expert usage
    in other communities. This Best Practice document applies specifically to WMS
    version 1.3, but many of the concepts and recommendations will be applicable to
    other versions of WMS or to other OGC services, such as the Web Coverage Service.\r\n"
