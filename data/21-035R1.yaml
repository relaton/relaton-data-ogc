abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 17 Engineering Report is deliverable D022 of the OGC
    Testbed 17 initiative performed under the OGC Innovation Program, incorporating
    the D022, D143 and D144 tasks that have produced Model Driven Architecture (MDA)
    tools.\r\n\r\nThis ER:\r\n\r\ndetails state-of-the-art analyses of existing MDA
    tools with their capabilities and limits; and\r\n\r\nprovides clear recommendations
    on how model-driven design can be fully exploited in the context of rich data
    model and API design efforts.\r\n\r\n"
