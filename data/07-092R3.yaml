abstract:
- content: 'This document specifies Universal Resource Names (URNs) in the “ogc” URN
    namespace to be used for identifying definitions. These definitions include definitions
    of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and related objects, as specified in OGC
    Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial referencing by coordinates, plus several
    other resource types for which standard identifiers are useful in OGC Web Services.
    This document specifies the formats used by these URNs, including formats that
    can reference definitions recorded in the EPSG database and by other authorities.
    This document also specifies URNs for some specific definitions for which OGC
    is the custodian.'
