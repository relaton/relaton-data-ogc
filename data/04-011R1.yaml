abstract:
- content: A Geolinking Service takes attribute data which refers to spatial features,
    and joins it to a geospatial dataset, so that it can be mapped by a WMS or used
    in a GIS.  When a Geolinking Service uses data from a GDAS, and serves as a front
    end to a WMS, it enables real-time mapping of data stored in non-spatial databases.
