abstract:
- content: "This specification defines the interfaces of the OGC (Geo)XACML Policy
    Administration Web Service (OGC (Geo)XACML PAWS or simply PAWS in the following)
    that supports the creation, modification, exchange, analysis, testing, transformation,
    encrypting and signing of XACML and GeoXACML encoded access control policies.\r\nThis
    draft specification was prepared as a deliverable for the OGC Web Services, Phase
    9 (OWS-9) initiative of the OGC Interoperability Program. This document presents
    the results of the work within add-on project of the OWS-9 Security and Services
    Interoperability (SSI) thread. \r\nPlease note that currently the document only
    contains the definition of the mandatory operations i.e. the basic conformance
    class. The writing of the sections describing the optional operations is still
    a to do. These sections need to define the following operations:\r\n•\tAnalyzePolicyElement
    operation\r\n•\tOptimizePolicyElement operation \r\n•\tTransformPolicyElement
    operation\r\n•\tTestPolicyElement operation \r\n•\tEncryptPolicy operation\r\n•\tSignPolicy
    operation \r\nSuggested additions, changes, and comments on this report are welcome
    and encouraged. Such suggestions may be submitted by email message or by making
    suggested changes in an edited copy of this document.\r\n"
