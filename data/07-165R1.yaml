abstract:
- content: A sensor network is a computer accessible network of many, spatially distributed
    devices using sensors to monitor conditions at different locations, such as temperature,
    sound, vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants[1]. A Sensor Web refers to web
    accessible sensor networks and archived sensor data that can be discovered and
    accessed using standard protocols and application program interfaces (APIs).
