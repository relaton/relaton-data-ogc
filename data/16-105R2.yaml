abstract:
- content: "This OGC InfraGML Encoding Standard presents the implementation-dependent,
    GML encoding of concepts supporting land and civil engineering infrastructure
    facilities specified in the OGC Land and Infrastructure Conceptual Model Standard
    (LandInfra), OGC 15-111r1. Conceptual model subject areas include land features,
    facilities, projects, alignment, road, railway, survey (including equipment, observations,
    and survey results), land division, and condominiums.\r\nInfraGML is published
    as a multi-part standard. This Part 5 addresses the Railway Requirements Class
    from LandInfra."
