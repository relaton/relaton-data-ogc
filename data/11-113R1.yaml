abstract:
- content: 'This report aims at providing an information model for the usage of video
    moving target indicator data (VMTI), ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and
    tracking information (STANAG 4676) in the context of standardized spatial data
    infrastructures compliant to OGC and ISO standards. If possible, precedence was
    given on using the OGC Sensor Web Enablement suite of standards, as this suite
    provides a homogeneous suite of standards to express sensor and sensor observation
    data in the context of OGC. This means that all encodings are based on Observation
    and Measurements version 2 (O&M) and implemented as an application schema according
    to the rules of Geography Markup Language version 3.2 (GML). An information model
    – so called ‘bookmark’ – to conserve the trace from a moving object back to the
    original base data is discussed briefly. '
