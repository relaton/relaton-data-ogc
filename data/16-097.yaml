abstract:
- content: Numerous and diverse technologies push cities towards open and platform-independent
    information infrastructures to manage human, natural, and physical systems. The
    Future Cities Pilot 1 (FCP1), as an OGC Innovation Program initiative, demonstrated
    how cities can benefit from open standards when used in urban planning workflows.
    This report details the lessons learned of implementing both the OGC CityGML and
    the buildingSMART Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standards for visualizing
    and processing 3D spatial data when used in urban planning processes.
