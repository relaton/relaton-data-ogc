abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report (ER) describes requirements that a point cloud
    web service must satisfy to enable application developers to provide convenient
    remote access to point clouds. It provides a short contrast of five point cloud
    web service software approaches (Esri I3S, 3D Tiles, Greyhound, PotreeConverter,
    and Entwine) and their implementations available at the time of the report. A
    small industry survey about these requirements is also provided in support of
    the reportâ€™s discussion about formats, web service requirements, industry support,
    and industry desire on these topics.\r\n\r\n"
