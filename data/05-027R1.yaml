abstract:
- content: "This document recommends standard XML encodings of data defining monoscopic
    image coordinate reference systems. The scope of this encoding now includes unrectified
    and georectified images. The recommended CRSs for georectified images are recommended
    for multiple georectified images that are ready to be mosaicked together.\r\n\r\nThese
    recommended encodings are based on GML 3.1.1 and use XML Schemas. These image
    CRS definitions will often be referenced in data transferred between client and
    server software that implements various standardised interfaces. This specified
    definition data encoding is expected to be used by multiple OGC Implementation
    Specifications. That is, each of these specifications is expected to use a subset
    and/or superset of this recommended definition data.\r\n\r\nThe position or location
    of a point can be described using coordinates. Such coordinates are unambiguous
    only when the coordinate reference system on which those coordinates are based
    is fully defined. Each position is described by a set of coordinates based on
    a specified coordinate reference system. Coordinates are often used in datasets
    in which all coordinates belong to the same coordinate reference system. This
    paper specifies XML encoding of data defining image coordinate reference systems.\r\n"
