abstract:
- content: "This OGC GML in JPEG 2000 (GMLJP2) Encoding Standard defines how the OGC/ISO
    Geography Markup Language (GML) standard is used within JPEG 2000 images and other
    gridded coverage data for adding geospatial content to imagery. Specifically,
    this OGC standard defines requirements for the encoding and decoding of JPEG 2000
    images and other gridded coverage data that contain XML documents that use GML
    and GML-based schema.\r\nThis document defines the use of GML within the XML boxes
    of the JP2 and JPX file format for JPEG 2000 (extending the JP2 file format, as
    specified in [ISO 15444-1] and [ISO 15444-2] in Annexes M and N). Further, an
    application schema for JPEG 2000 that can be extended to include geometrical feature
    descriptions and annotations is specified. The document also specifies the encoding
    and packaging rules for GML use in JPEG 2000.\r\n"
