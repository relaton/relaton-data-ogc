abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed-18 (TB-18) Features Filtering Summary Engineering Report
    (ER) summarizes the implementations, findings, and recommendations that emerged
    from the efforts to better understand the current OGC API-Features filtering capabilities
    and limitations and how filtering can be decoupled from data services.\r\n\r\nThis
    ER describes:\r\n\r\n*\ttwo façades built to interface SWIM services and serve
    aviation data through APIs (built with OGC API Standards) including basic filtering
    capabilities;\r\n*\tthe two filtering services built to consume SWIM data and
    serve it through OGC based APIs featuring advanced filtering mechanism;\r\n*\tthe
    client application built to interface with the filtering services; and\r\n*\tthe
    developer client built to define filter statements that can be expressed in a
    machine-readable way and exchanged with the filtering service."
