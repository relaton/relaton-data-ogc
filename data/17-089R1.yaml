abstract:
- content: "The OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) supports electronic retrieval of geospatial
    data as coverages. Coverages are digital geospatial information representing space/time-varying
    phenomena, specifically spatio-temporal regular and irregular grids, point clouds,
    and general meshes.\r\nThis document specifies the WCS core. Every implementation
    of a WCS shall adhere to this standard. This standard defines core requirements.
    Extensions to the core define extensions to meet additional requirements, such
    as the response encoding. Additional extensions are required in order to completely
    specify a WCS for implementation.\r\nThis WCS 2.1 standard extends WCS 2.0 in
    a backwards compatible manner by accommodating coverages as per the OGC Coverage
    Implementation Schema (CIS) 1.1 in addition to CIS 1.0 coverages as addressed
    by WCS 2.0.\r\n"
