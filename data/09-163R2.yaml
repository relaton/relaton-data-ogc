abstract:
- content: "This document describes the mapping of description of sensors using SensorML
    specification 1.0 [OGC 07-000] to an ebRIM structure within an OGCTM Catalogue
    2.0.2 (Corrigendum 2 Release) [OGC 07-006r1] implementing the CSW-ebRIM Registry
    Service â€“ part 1: ebRIM profile of CSW [OGC 07-110r4].\r\nIn addition this document
    contains the definition of a SensorML profile for Discovery which defines a minimum
    set of metadata to be provided within SensorML documents as well as the structure
    this data shall possess. This profile is based on the OGC OWS- 6 SensorML Profile
    for Discovery Engineering Report [OGC 09-033].\r\nIt defines the way sensors metadata
    are organized and implemented in the Catalogue for discovery, retrieval and management."
