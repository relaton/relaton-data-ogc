abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the HTTP profile of the CSW General Model part
    (see OGC 12-\r\n168r6). The General Model specifies the abstract interfaces between
    clients and catalogue\r\nservices. This standard specifies the mappingof the Catalogue
    abstract model interface\r\ninto the HTTP protocol binding.\r\nIn this HTTP protocol
    binding, operation requests and responses are sent between clients\r\nand servers
    using the HTTP GET and/or HTTP POST methods. Two equivalent request\r\nencodings
    are defined in this standard. The first using keyword-value pairs (KVP)\r\nwhich
    is suitable for use with the HTTP GET method. The second using XML which is\r\nsuitable
    for use with the HTTP POST method.\r\nThis standard defines operations that allow
    a client to get a service description document\r\nfor the catalogue (i.e. GetCapabilities);
    operations that allow a client to, at runtime,\r\ninterrogate the service about
    the kinds of data available (i.e. GetDomain); operations that\r\nallow a client
    to retrieve records from the catalogue (i.e. GetRecordById and\r\nGetRecords);
    operations that allow a client to add, modify and remove records from the\r\ncatalogue
    service (i.e. Transaction, Harvest, UnHarvest)."
