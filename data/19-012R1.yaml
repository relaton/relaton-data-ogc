abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 15 Engineering Report (ER) documents the design of a
    service architecture that allows the delivery of prioritized updates of features
    to a client, possibly acting in a DDIL (Denied, Degraded, Intermitted or Limited
    Bandwidth) environment. Two different technical scenarios were investigated and
    tested:\r\n\r\nThe enhancement of Web Feature Service (WFS) instances to support
    updates on features sets.\r\n\r\nUtilizing a Web Processing Service (WPS) instance
    to access features, without the need to modify the downstream data service."
