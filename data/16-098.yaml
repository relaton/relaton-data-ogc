abstract:
- content: 'The Future City Pilot Phase 1 (FCP1) is an OGC Interoperability Program
    initiative in collaboration with buildingSMART International (bSI). The pilot
    aimed at demonstrating and enhancing the ability of spatial data infrastructures
    to support quality of life, civic initiatives, and urban resilience. During the
    pilot, multiple scenarios were set up based on real-world requirements and were
    put forward by the pilot sponsors: Sant Cugat del Vallès (Barcelona, Spain), Ordnance
    Survey Great Britain (UK), virtualcitySYSTEMS GmbH (Germany), and Institut National
    de l’Information Géographique et Forestière - IGN (France). The scenarios were
    focused on (i) the interoperability between the two international standards: Industry
    Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML; (ii) city flood modeling; and (iii) supporting
    real-time sensor readings and other time-dependent properties within semantic
    3D city models. The solutions for the respective scenarios were developed by the
    pilot participants: University of Melbourne (Australia), Remote Sensing Solutions,
    Inc. (U.S.A), and Technical University of Munich (Germany). This Engineering Report
    (ER) focuses on the third scenario requiring the support of real-time sensors
    and other time-dependent properties within semantic 3D city models based on the
    CityGML standard. It highlights a new concept ''Dynamizer'', which allows representation
    of highly dynamic data in different and generic ways and providing a method for
    injecting dynamic variations of city object properties into the static representations.
    It also establishes explicit links between sensor/observation data and the respective
    properties of city model objects that are measured by them. The Dynamizer concept
    has been implemented as an Application Domain Extension (ADE) of the CityGML standard.
    This implementation allows to use new dynamizer features with the current version
    of the CityGML standard (CityGML 2.0). The advantage with this approach is that
    it allows for selected properties of city models to become dynamic without changing
    the original CityGML data model. If an application does not support dynamic data,
    it simply does not allow/include these special types of features. The details
    and results of the pilot are mentioned in the following YouTube video: https://youtu.be/aSQFIPwf2oM'
