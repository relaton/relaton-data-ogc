abstract:
- content: "This OGCÂ® Engineering Report describes the architecture of a WPS capable
    of conflating two datasets while capturing provenance information about the process.
    The report also provides information about defining and encoding conflation rules
    and about encoding provenance information. \r\nThis Engineering Report was created
    as a deliverable for the OGC Web Services, Phase 9 (OWS-9) initiative of the OGC
    Interoperability Program.\r\n"
