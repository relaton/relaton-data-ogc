abstract:
- content: This document specifies how a Web Coverage Service (WCS) offers multi-dimensional
    coverage data for access over the Internet. This document specifies a core set
    of requirements that a WCS implementation must fulfil. WCS extension standards
    add further functionality to this core; some of these are required in addition
    to the core to obtain a complete implementation. This document indicates which
    extensions, at a minimum, need to be considered in addition to this core to allow
    for a complete WCS implementation.
