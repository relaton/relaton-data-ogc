abstract:
- content: "This Discussion Paper specifies a potential OGC Candidate Standard for
    a JSON implementation of the OGC and ISO Observations and Measurements (O&M) conceptual
    model (OGC Observations and Measurements v2.0 also published as ISO/DIS 19156).
    This encoding is expected to be useful in RESTful implementations of observation
    services. \r\nMore specifically, this Discussion Paper defines JSON schemas for
    observations, and for features involved in sampling when making observations.
    These provide document models for the exchange of information describing observation
    acts and their results, both within and between different scientific and technical
    communities.\r\n"
