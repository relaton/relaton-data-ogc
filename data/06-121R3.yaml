abstract:
- content: The OpenGISÂ® Web Services Common (WS-Common) Interface Standard specifies
    parameters and data structures that are common to all OGC Web Service (OWS) Standards.
    The standard normalizes the ways in which operation requests and responses handle
    such elements as bounding boxes, exception processing, URL requests, URN expressions,
    and key value encoding. Among its uses, this document serves as a normative reference
    for other OGC Web Service standards, including the OpenGIS Web Map Service (WMS)
    [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms], Web Feature Service (WFS) [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs],
    and Web Coverage Service (WCS) [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs] standards.
    Rather than continuing to repeat this material in each such standard, each standard
    will normatively reference parts of this document.
