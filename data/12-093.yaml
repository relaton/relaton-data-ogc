abstract:
- content: "The main scope of the schema automation activities in the OWS-9 initiative
    was twofold:\r\n•\tSupport for the SWE Common 2.0 XML Schema encoding rule\r\n•\tDevelopment
    of and support for an encoding rule for JSON instance data\r\nIn both cases the
    scope includes implementation of the encoding rules in ShapeChange.\r\nIn addition,
    an initial analysis of the possibilities for generating SWE Common 2.0 record
    descriptions from schemas in UML has been conducted and the results are described
    in this document.\r\nThe approach and results to both work items are described
    and discussed in this engineering report. This Engineering Report has been prepared
    as part of the OGC Web Services Phase 9 (OWS-9) initiative.\r\n"
