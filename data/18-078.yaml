abstract:
- content: "Feature data tiling, colloquially referred to as 'vector tiling', is a
    data delivery method that allows for large vector feature datasets to be systematically
    split into subsets or tiles [1]. This engineering report (ER) presents an extension
    specification for publishing of vector tiles data through an Application Programming
    Interface (API) that conforms to the emerging version 3.0 of the Web Feature Service
    (WFS) standard. The core of the WFS 3.0 standard offers direct fine-grained access
    to geospatial information at the feature level. The WFS standard specifies discovery
    and query operations for web services that publish feature data. Extensions to
    the WFS 3.0 Core API offer other capabilities such as transaction operations.\r\n\r\n"
