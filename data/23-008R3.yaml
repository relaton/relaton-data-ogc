abstract:
- content: "The Training Data Markup Language for Artificial Intelligence (TrainingDML-AI)
    Standard aims to develop the UML model and encodings for geospatial machine learning
    training data. Training data plays a fundamental role in Earth Observation (EO)
    Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning (AI/ML), especially Deep Learning (DL).
    It is used to train, validate, and test AI/ML models. This Standard defines a
    UML model and encodings consistent with the OGC Standards baseline to exchange
    and retrieve the training data in the Web environment.\r\n\r\nThe TrainingDML-AI
    Standard provides detailed metadata for formalizing the information model of training
    data. This includes but is not limited to the following aspects:\r\n\r\nHow the
    training data is prepared, such as provenance or quality;\r\nHow to specify different
    metadata used for different ML tasks such as scene/object/pixel levels;\r\nHow
    to differentiate the high-level training data information model and extended information
    models specific to various ML applications; and\r\nHow to introduce external classification
    schemes and flexible means for representing ground truth labeling."
