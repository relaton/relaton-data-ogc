abstract:
- content: "Ad-hoc processing of Earth Observation (EO) data available through online
    resources is\r\ngaining more and more attention. Expected benefits include\r\n-
    More versatile EO data access\r\n- More convenient EO data access\r\n- Consequently,
    broadened use and exploitation of EO data\r\n- An important step towards integration
    of EO data into automatic chaining and\r\norchestration\r\n- More efficient EO
    data access: indicating the exact desired result and evaluating\r\nprocessing
    code close to the coverage data source (i.e., on the server) minimizes\r\nnetwork
    traffic, one of todayâ€™s critical performance limiting factors."
