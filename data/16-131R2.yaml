abstract:
- content: "This white paper is a survey of Big Geospatial Data with these main themes:\r\n\r\n
    \ Geospatial data is increasing in volume and variety;\r\n  New Big Data computing
    techniques are being applied to geospatial data;\r\n  Geospatial Big Data techniques
    benefit many applications; and\r\n  Open standards are needed for interoperability,
    efficiency, innovation and cost effectiveness.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe main purpose of
    this White Paper is to identify activities to be undertaken in OGC Programs that
    advance the Big Data capabilities as applied to geospatial information.\r\n\r\nThis
    white paper was developed based on two Location Powers events:\r\n\r\n  Location
    Powers: Big Data, Orlando, September 20th, 2016; and\r\n  Location Powers: Big
    Linked Data, Delft, March 22nd, 2017.\r\nFor information on Location Powers: http://www.locationpowers.net/pastevents/"
