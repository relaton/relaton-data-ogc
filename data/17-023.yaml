abstract:
- content: "The Application Package OGC Engineering Report (ER) defines a data model
    and serialization for Thematic Exploitation Platforms (TEP) Application Packages.
    A TEP refers to a computing platform that follows a given set of scenarios for
    users, data and ICT provision aggregated around an Earth Science thematic area.
    This ER is part of the Testbed-13 Earth Observation Clouds (EOC) effort to support
    the development by the European Space Agency (ESA) of the TEP by exercising envisioned
    workflows for data integration, processing, and analytics based on algorithms
    developed by users that are deployed in multiple clouds.\r\n\r\nThe wide usage
    of virtualization and the possibility to start virtual environments within Cloud
    services significantly simplifies the creation of environments and provisioning
    of resources. However, it still leaves a problem of portability between infrastructures.
    This ER identifies a strategy for packaging an application in a Cloud environment
    that will be able to run in a predictable manner in different computing production
    environments. The application packaging specifies the elements that will ensure:\r\n\r\nScientific
    reproducibility,\r\n\r\nDependencies identification and management,\r\n\r\nMaintainability
    from an operational perspective and avoid version pilling,\r\n\r\nPortability
    in different Cloud providers\r\n\r\nThe ER proposes the use of containers, defining
    everything required to make a piece of software run packaged into isolated containers.
    Unlike a Virtual Machine (VM), a container does not bundle a full Operating System
    (OS) - only libraries and settings required to make the software work are needed.
    This makes for efficient, lightweight, self-contained systems and guarantees that
    software will always run the same, regardless of where it’s deployed. A discussion
    on application deployment and execution is presented in the separate OGC Testbed-13
    Application Deployment and Execution Service ER [1].\r\n\r\n"
