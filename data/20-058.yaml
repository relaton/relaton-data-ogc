abstract:
- content: The OGC Interoperable Simulation and Gaming Year 2 Sprint advanced the
    use of relevant OGC and Khronos Group [1] standards in the modeling, simulation,
    and training communities through capability development, compatibility testing,
    and gap analysis. Of particular interest was the use of glTF models, game engines,
    and 3rd-party mobile device libraries for the display and interaction with data
    using OGC APIs.
