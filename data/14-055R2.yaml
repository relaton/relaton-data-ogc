abstract:
- content: "This standard describes the GeoJSON encoding of the OGC Web Services (OWS)
    Context conceptual model. This standard defines how to encode an OWS context document
    that 1.) can be extended to allow a context referencing a fully configured service
    set, and 2.) can be defined and consistently interpreted by clients.\r\nThe OWS
    Context Document standard (OWS Context) was created to allow a set of configured
    information resources to be passed between applications primarily as a collection
    of services (but also potentially in-line content). The objective is to support
    use cases such as the distribution of search results, the exchange of a set of
    resources in a Common Operating Picture (COP), or delivery of a set of configured
    processing services to allow the processing to be reproduced on different processing
    nodes.\r\nThe goal for OWS Context is to replace previous OGC standards and best
    practices that provide similar capability. Web Map Context (WMC) has been reasonably
    successful but is limited to working with only Web Map Service (WMS) instances.
    Other work on the Location Organizer Folder1 (LOF) was also taken into consideration.
    The concept of OWS Context and the first prototype document was produced as part
    of OWS Testbed 7 and documented in [OGC10-035r1], Information Sharing Engineering
    Report.\r\nA principal goal of the OWS Context SWG was to develop encodings that
    would appeal for use in mass market applications yet also provide facilities for
    more advanced uses. OWS-7 originally considered the application of existing encoding
    standards for OWS Context. The OGC Standards Working Group (SWG) has concluded
    that this standard can have multiple encoding formats and that each encoding format
    will be described in a separate OGC Extension to the Core model.\r\n"
