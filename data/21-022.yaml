abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 17 Engineering Report (ER) documents the outcomes of
    a review and implementation of the Sensor Integration Framework Standards Profile
    (SIF-SP) v1.0.1, published by the National Center for Geospatial Intelligence
    Standards (NCGIS).\r\n\r\nThe Sensor Integration Framework Standard Profiles (SIF-SP)
    authors rightly acknowledge that sensing systems and the environments they operate
    in (e.g. hardware platform, computing resources, connectivity, ease of deployment,
    etc.) are very heterogeneous and that there will never be a single suite of technology
    or standards that can support the goal of providing unified access to sensor deployments
    employed in complex applications.\r\n\r\nInstead, rather than trying to impose
    a single standard or suite of standards, the SIF-SP approach defines common conceptual
    models that can be mapped to existing and future standards, thus allowing integration
    of all these standards in a single framework.\r\n\r\nThis approach is fully compatible
    with the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) suite of standards that were designed
    for this type of integration. Thus, existing and upcoming SWE standards defined
    in the OGC can be used as the central pillar of a SIF implementation. The test
    implementation developed in this testbed, and based on OpenSensorHub, focused
    on demonstrating this aspect.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a thorough review of the SIF
    material — including standards documents, UML models and ontologies — a prototype
    implementation of the SIF standards was created during the Testbed using OpenSensorHub.
    This allowed the testbed participants to check the practical feasibility of fulfilling
    the SIF requirements using the OGC SWE suite of standards. Details and feedback
    regarding this implementation are also provided in this ER.\r\n\r\nSuggestions
    to improve SIF-SP and make it an integral part of the OGC standard baseline are
    also provided.\r\n\r\n"
