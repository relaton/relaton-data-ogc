abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report discusses the approach of Map Markup Language
    (MapML) and Map for HyperText Markup Language (Map4HTML) described in: https://github.com/Maps4HTML
    and supported by the community in https://www.w3.org/community/maps4html/. The
    objective of MapML is to define a hypermedia type for geospatial maps on the web
    that can be embedded in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) pages. MapML is needed
    because while Web browsers implement HTML and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG),
    including the <map> element, those implementations do not meet the requirements
    of the broader Web mapping community. The semantics of the HTML map element are
    incomplete or insufficient relative to modern Web maps and mapping in general.
    Currently, robust web maps are implemented by a variety of non-standard technologies.
    Web maps do not work without script support, making their creation a job beyond
    the realm of beginners' skill sets. In order to improve collaboration and integration
    of the mapping and Web communities, it is desirable to enhance or augment the
    functionality of the <map> element in HTML to include the accessible user interface
    functions of modern web maps (e.g. panning, zooming, searching for, and zooming
    to, styling, identifying featuresâ€™ properties, etc.), while maintaining a simple,
    declarative, accessible interface for HTML authors.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this
    Engineering Report is to explore how MapML can be harmonized with the OGC standards
    mainstream and contribute to the progress of the specification avoiding unnecessary
    duplication. In particular, the ER proposes Web Map Service (WMS) or Web Map Tile
    Service (WMTS) as services that can be used to deliver MapML documents with small
    modifications.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration on the ER is the inclusion of the
    time dimension and directions operation in MapML."
