abstract:
- content: "In 2017 the OGC began a focused effort to develop Application Programming
    Interface (API) standards that support the Resource Oriented Architecture and
    make use of the OpenAPI specification. As part of this effort, this OGC Testbed
    15 Engineering Report (ER) defines a proof-of-concept of an API specification
    for maps and tiles.\r\n\r\nThe OGC API Maps and Tiles draft specification described
    in this ER builds on the precedent of the OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core standard.
    The OGC API - Tiles draft specification describes a service that retrieves data
    representations as tiles, which are generally small compared with the geographic
    extent of the data. In the draft specification, the assumption is that tiles are
    organized into Tile Matrix Sets consisting of regular tile matrices available
    at different scales or resolutions. The OGC API – Tiles draft specification is
    described as a building block that can be plugged into an OGC API - Features service
    to retrieve tiled feature data (sometimes called vector tiles) or to an OGC API
    – Maps implementation to retrieve rendered tiles (sometimes called map tiles).
    In the future, the OGC API - Tiles draft specification could extend other specifications,
    one possible candidate being the emerging OGC API – Coverages draft specification.\r\n\r\nThe
    OGC API - Maps draft specification describes an API that presents data as maps
    by applying a style. These maps can be retrieved in a tiled structure (if OGC
    API - Tiles is approved as an OGC Implementation Standard) or as maps of any size
    generated on-the-fly. The OGC API - Maps draft specification implements some functionality,
    specified in the Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) 1.0 standard, related to the use
    of styles by using the Styles API draft specification that was developed in the
    Testbed-15 Open Portrayal Framework thread.\r\n\r\nThe draft Maps and Tiles API
    specifications are designed in a modular way. With the exception of the core requirements,
    the other conformance classes describe functionality that can be considered optional
    characteristics that can be combined by server implementations at will.\r\n\r\nAt
    the beginning of Testbed-15, the original proposed title for this ER was OGC Testbed-15:
    Web Map Tiling Service Draft Specification Engineering Report but in the course
    of the Testbed-15 that title was changed to better represent the content."
