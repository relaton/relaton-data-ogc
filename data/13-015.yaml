abstract:
- content: "This document comprises experiences and recommendations when using\r\nSensor
    Web Enablement (SWE) concepts. This document focuses on\r\none basic issue: the
    provision of observations in an OGC SOS.\r\nThis includes the definition of a
    lightweight OGC SOS profile (OGC 11-\r\n169r1), an analysis of and contribution
    to the specification of the Sensor\r\nObservation Service (SOS) 2.0 as well as
    an approach how the data\r\nused within Earth observation (EO) applications can
    be integrated more\r\neasily into SOS instances.\r\nThese recommendations result
    from the work performed in 2010-2013\r\nas part of the research project EO2HEAVEN
    (Earth Observation and\r\nEnvironmental Modelling for the Mitigation of Health
    Risks), co-funded\r\nby the European Commission as part of the 7th Framework Programme\r\n(FP7)
    Environmental theme. EO2HEAVEN contributes to a better understanding\r\nof the
    complex relationships between environmental changes\r\nand their impact on human
    health. See http://www.eo2heaven.org/ .\r\nThe lightweight OGC SOS profile has
    been developed in close cooperation\r\nbetween the FP7 projects EO2HEAVEN and
    UncertWeb (see\r\nhttp://www.uncertweb.org/ )."
