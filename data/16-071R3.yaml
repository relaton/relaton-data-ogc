abstract:
- content: "OWL-Time is an OWL-2 DL ontology of temporal concepts, for describing
    the temporal properties of resources in the world or described in Web pages. The
    ontology provides a vocabulary for expressing facts about topological (ordering)
    relations among instants and intervals, together with information about durations,
    and about temporal position including date-time information. Time positions and
    durations may be expressed using either the conventional (Gregorian) calendar
    and clock, or using another temporal reference system such as Unix-time, geologic
    time, or different calendars.\r\n\r\n"
