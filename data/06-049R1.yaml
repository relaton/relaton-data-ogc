abstract:
- content: "The OpenGISÂ® GML 3.1.1 Simple Features Profile (GML for Simple Features)
    is a restricted subset of GML (Geography Markup Language)[http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml]
    and XML Schema [www.w3.org/XML/Schema] that supports the XML encoding of geographic
    features with simple geometric property types (Points, Line and Polygons).  The
    profile defines three conformance classes that define three different levels of
    complexity. \r\n\r\nSee also the GML pages on OGC Network: http://www.ogcnetwork.net/gml
