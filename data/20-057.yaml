abstract:
- content: "OGC API — Tiles is a standard defining building blocks for creating Web
    APIs that support the retrieval of geospatial information as tiles. Different
    forms of geospatial information are supported, such as tiles of vector features
    (“vector tiles”), coverages, maps (or imagery) and other types of geospatial information.
    Although it can be used independently, the OGC API — Tiles building blocks can
    be combined with other OGC API Standards and draft specifications for additional
    capabilities or increasing interoperability for specific types of data. The OGC
    API — Tiles standard references the OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set (TMS)
    and Tileset Metadata standard, which defines logical models and encodings for
    specifying tile matrix sets and describing tile sets. A tile matrix set is a tiling
    scheme that enables an application to partition and index space based on a set
    of regular grids defined for multiple scales in a Coordinate Reference System
    (CRS).\r\n\r\nThis specification is a successor to the OGC’s Web Map Tile Service
    (WMTS) standard, focusing on simple reusable REST API building blocks which can
    be described using the OpenAPI specification. Whereas WMTS focused on map tiles,
    the OGC API — Tiles standard has been designed to support any form of tiled data."
