abstract:
- content: Data cubes, multidimensional arrays of data, are used frequently these
    days, but differences in design, interfaces, and handling of temporal characteristics
    are causing interoperability challenges for anyone interacting with more than
    one solution. To address these challenges, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
    and the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) invited global data cube experts to discuss
    state-of-the-art and way forward at the “Towards Data Cube Interoperability” workshop.
    The two-day workshop, conducted in late April 2021, started with a series of pre-recorded
    position statements by data cube providers and data cube users. These videos served
    as the entry points for intense discussions that not only produced a new definition
    of the term ‘data cube’ (by condensing and shifting emphasize on what is known
    as the six faces model), but also pointed out a wide variety of expectations with
    regards to data cube behaviour and characteristics as well as data cube usage
    patterns. This report summarizes the various perspectives and discusses the next
    steps towards efficient usage of data cubes. It starts with the new definition
    of the term Data Cube, as this new understanding drives several recommendations
    discussed later in this report. The report includes further discussion that followed
    the actual workshop, mainly conducted in the context of the Geo Data Cube task
    in OGC Testbed-17.
