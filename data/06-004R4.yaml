abstract:
- content: This document is a reference model for digital rights management (DRM)
    functionality for geospatial resources (GeoDRM). As such, it is connected to the
    general DRM market in that geospatial resources must be treated as nearly as possible
    like other digital resources, such as music, text, or services. It is not the
    intention here to reinvent a market that already exists and is thriving, but to
    make sure that a larger market has access to geospatial resources through a mechanism
    that it understands and that is similar to the ones already in use.
