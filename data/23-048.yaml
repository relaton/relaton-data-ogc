abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 19 Engineering Report documents a draft OGC API — GeoDataCube
    Standard (aka GDC API). The OGC Member participants in this Testbed 19 activity
    developed, documented, and tested the draft OGC GDC API Standard. The draft will
    be submitted to the OGC GeoDataCube Standards Working Group (SWG) as a new standards
    work item.\r\n\r\nThe OGC GeoDataCube SWG was chartered to respond to the long-standing
    issue of establishing a standard that supports accessing and processing geospatial
    datacubes in an interoperable way. The draft OGC API — GeoDataCube that was developed
    in OGC Testbed 19 responds to this need and proposes a draft API specification.\r\n\r\nThe
    Testbed 19 GDC initiative targeted enhanced interoperability. The draft GDC API
    Standard was based on OGC API — Common, OGC API — Coverages Standard, OGC API
    — Processes Standard, the STAC API, and the openEO API. The Testbed 19 participants
    concentrated on server and client application development, and usability testing
    based on conformance classes and use cases. The draft GDC API is defined as an
    OpenAPI 3.0 document and provides endpoints for capabilities, data discovery/access,
    process discovery, and data processing. Notably, the draft GDI API Standard is
    extensible through additional implementations of OGC API Standards or openEO API
    parts. Documentation is available in machine-readable YAML and human-friendly
    HTML through a GitHub repository."
