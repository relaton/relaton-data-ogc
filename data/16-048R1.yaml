abstract:
- content: "The OGC suite of standards address the interoperable exchange of geographic
    information. The Web Service Implementation Standards define the discovery, delivery,
    and processing services that make information exchange possible. Common aspects
    of those Web Service standards have been collected into the OGC Web Services Common
    standard. While there are multiple versions of OWS Common, and flexibility in
    how it is applied, this combination of standards does enable interoperability.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    OWS Common neglected to address security. As soon as a service endpoint (an OGC
    Web Service instance) is secured, there is no guarantee of interoperability.\r\n\r\nThe
    OWS Common - Security Standards Working Group (SWG) was approved by the TC in
    September 2015 (http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/comsecurityswg).
    It held its first meeting during the December 2015 TC meetings. The objective
    of this SWG to define an extension to the existing OWS Common to ensure interoperability
    between a secured service instance and client. This OWS Common Security Extension
    adds content to the standard regarding the implementation of security controls
    in such a way as to preserve interoperability. These additions will be in two
    areas. The first extension will provide more detail on the use of the HTTP protocol,
    particularly as it related to security controls. The second extension will address
    discovery and negotiation of security controls. This will provide an annotation
    model for the Capabilities document to enable a service provider to specify the
    security implemented at a service instance (endpoint).\r\n\r\nThis ER shall serve
    as the technical background to the OWS Common - Security SWG to ensure that the
    standard that is to be created is comprehensive and suitable for all OGC Web Services
    standards, to overcome the interoperability hurdle, and - at the same time - maintain
    backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n"
