abstract:
- content: This Best Practice describes how to configure XML documents for single
    and time series water quality measurements.  In addition to stating the rules
    for using the O&M and WML 2 standards, along with the appropriate content ontologies,
    this Best Practice provides guidance through examples. This document is intended
    to complement WaterML 2.0 as part of a suite of standards for water observation
    data.
