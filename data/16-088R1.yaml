abstract:
- content: "This engineering report describes the results of the Soil Data Interoperability
    Experiment\r\n(the IE) conducted under the auspices of the OGC Agriculture Domain
    Working Group in\r\n2015. Soil data exchange and analysis is compromised by the
    lack of a widely agreed\r\ninternational standard for the exchange of data describing
    soils and the sampling and\r\nanalytical activities relating to them. Previous
    modeling activities in Europe and\r\nAustralasia have not yielded models that
    satisfy many of the data needs of global soil\r\nscientists, data custodians and
    users. This IE evaluated existing models and proposed a\r\ncommon core model,
    including a GML/XML schema, which was tested through the\r\ndeployment of OGC
    web services and demonstration clients. IE time constraints and\r\nlimited participant
    resources precluded extensive modeling activities. However, the\r\nresulting model
    should form the core of a more comprehensive model to be developed by\r\na future
    OGC Soil Data Standards Working Group."
