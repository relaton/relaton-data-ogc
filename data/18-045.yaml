abstract:
- content: "The objective of the Next Generation APIs - WFS 3.0 effort in OGC Testbed-14
    was to develop and test the Web Feature Service (WFS) version 3.0 candidate standard.
    The initiative assessed OpenAPI, security based on OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0
    and WFS 3.0 extensions. The effort also began to assess methods to ease geospatial
    enterprise transition to next generation Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\r\n\r\nThe
    purpose of this effort was not to preempt other next generation work taking place
    in OGC, but rather to inform and complement that work.\r\n\r\nThis Engineering
    Report (ER) describes the implementations and experiments conducted by OGC Testbed-14
    participants to test next generation Web APIs. It includes descriptions of APIs
    to simplify and secure access to geospatial feature resources, and was tested
    in a scenario that showed how WFS 3.0 can support humanitarian relief activities."
