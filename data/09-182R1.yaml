abstract:
- content: 'This Architecture Implementation Pilot, Phase 2 Engineering Report (AIP-2
    ER) describes the practice of deploying, documenting, and registering contributed
    resources from the point of view of classes of GEOSS users who rely on GEOSS to
    support discovery and access to those resources. It emphasizes two paradigms for
    the GEOSS Common Infrastructure: 1) Service-oriented infrastructure for development
    of service-based community applications by technically advanced users; and 2)
    Content-oriented search facility and Web-based access mechanisms for end-users
    with a range of technical skills and domain knowledge. End-to-end here refers
    to the bidirectional connection between desired discovery practices and goals
    on the user end; and the required resource interfaces and documentation on the
    provider end.'
