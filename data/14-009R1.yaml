abstract:
- content: This document identifies the generic rules for obtaining JSON documents
    directly from existing XML documents and schemas elements. It is primordially
    targeting the OWS Context JSON Encoding design, but is presented in a generic
    approach. Such generic approach can offer the guidelines for other OGC services,
    when defining and using JSON encodings.
