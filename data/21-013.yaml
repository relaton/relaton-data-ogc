abstract:
- content: "This engineering report (ER) presents the results of a Concept Development
    Study (CDS) on Modernizing Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), sponsored by Natural
    Resources Canada, executed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The focus
    of this study was to understand how to best support the modernization of SDI(s)
    by enabling increased data interoperability for Regional Assessments (RA) and
    Cumulative Effects (CE), to advance the understanding of stakeholder issues, and
    serve stakeholdersâ€™ needs in these contexts. The study was completed through stakeholder
    engagements including an open Request for Information (RFI) that gathered external
    international positions and opinions on the optimal setup and design of a modernized
    SDI. In addition, a stakeholder Modernizing SDI Workshop was also employed providing
    in depth information on requirements and issues related to stakeholders, architecture,
    data, and standards of current and future SDI.\r\n\r\nThe RFI and workshop also
    gathered information and provided insight on the current state of SDIs to better
    support governments, agencies, non-governmental organizations and citizens, unlocking
    the full societal and economic potential of the wealth of data at national, regional
    and/or local levels.\r\n\r\nThe ER presents an analysis of the RFI and Modernizing
    SDI Workshop responses and interactions, providing in-depth information on requirements
    and issues related to stakeholders, architecture, data, standards of current and
    possible future SDI modernization. All RFI and workshop responses will contribute
    to SDI modernization efforts moving forward and help to assess interoperability,
    availability and usability of geospatial Web services and tools across different
    types of spatial data uses. In addition, the report identifies gaps, and defines
    core components of a possible future SDI.\r\n\r\nThe outflow of this report may
    be used to help define reference use-cases and scenarios for possible future research
    and follow-on OGC Innovation Program activities."
