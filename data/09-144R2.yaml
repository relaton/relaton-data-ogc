abstract:
- content: This document provides guidance on GML MIME type specification. An Internet
    media type, originally called a MIME type after Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
    and sometimes a Content-type after the name of a header in several protocols whose
    value is such a type, is a two-part identifier for file formats on the Internet.
    The identifiers were originally defined in RFC 2046 for use in e-mail sent through
    SMTP, but their use has expanded to other protocols such as HTTP, RTP and SIP.
