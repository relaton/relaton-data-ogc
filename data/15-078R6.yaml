abstract:
- content: The OGC SensorThings API provides an open, geospatial-enabled and unified
    way to interconnect the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data, and applications
    over the Web. At a high level the OGC SensorThings API provides two main functionalities
    and each function is handled by a part. The two parts are the Sensing part and
    the Tasking part. The Sensing part provides a standard way to manage and retrieve
    observations and metadata from heterogeneous IoT sensor systems. The Tasking part
    is planned as a future work activity and will be defined in a separate document
    as the Part II of the SensorThings API.
