abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a GML coverage structure extending the definition
    of GML 3.2.1 [07-036] in a compatible way.\r\n\r\nMain change over GML is the
    addition of one mandatory component, rangeType, to the Coverage definition of
    GML 3.2.1 to provide a concise description of the coverage range\r\nvalue definition.
    Further, handling of format encodings different from GML are established.\r\n\r\nThis
    enhanced coverage type is used, for example, by the Web Coverage Service (WCS)
    Standard [1] version 2.0 and higher, but is independent from WCS service. This
    augmented\r\ncoverage structure can serve a wide range of coverage application
    domains and service types, thereby contributing to harmonization and interoperability."
