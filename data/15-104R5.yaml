abstract:
- content: This document specifies the core Abstract Specification and extension mechanisms
    for Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS). A DGGS is a spatial reference system
    that uses a hierarchical tessellation of cells to partition and address the globe.
    DGGS are characterized by the properties of their cell structure, geo-encoding,
    quantization strategy and associated mathematical functions.The OGC DGGS Abstract
    Specification supports the specification of standardized DGGS infrastructures
    that enable the integrated analysis of very large, multi-source, multi-resolution,
    multi-dimensional, distributed geospatial data. Interoperability between OGC DGGS
    implementations is anticipated through implementation standards, and extension
    interface encodings of OGC Web Services.
