abstract:
- content: 'The subject of this Engineering Report (ER) is a code sprint that was
    held from 29 to 30 September 2020 to advance the development of the OGC API -
    Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data draft standard and the OGC API – Features – Part
    4: Simple Transactions draft standard. An Application Programming Interface (API)
    is a standard set of documented and supported functions and procedures that expose
    the capabilities or data of an operating system, application or service to other
    applications (adapted from ISO/IEC TR 13066-2:2016). The code sprint was hosted
    online. The event was sponsored by Ordnance Survey (OS).'
