abstract:
- content: 'The OpenGISÂ® Observations and Measurements Encoding Standard (O&M) defines
    an abstract model and an XML schema [www.w3.org/XML/Schema] encoding for observations
    and it provides support for common sampling strategies. O&M also provides a general
    framework for systems that deal in technical measurements in science and engineering.
    This is one of the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) [http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/markets-technologies/swe]
    suite of standards. '
