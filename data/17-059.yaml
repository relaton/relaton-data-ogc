abstract:
- content: "The DGIWG Portrayal Technical Panel (DPTP) has been investigating how
    to standardize the portrayal of military context symbology within Web Services.
    The team sought to use version 1.1.0 of OGC Style Layer Descriptor standard and
    version 1.1.0 of Symbology Encoding (SLD and SE) standard to achieve this.\r\nThe
    team sought to apply military-specific symbology to military-specific topographic
    feature vector datasets within a number of software products.\r\nThe testing and
    experimentation highlighted a number of deficiencies in the SLD and SE standards
    which result in a barrier to interoperability. The ideal situation would be to
    have SLD and SE descriptors interoperable between all software products that implement
    the standard. This was found not to be the current situation.\r\nThis position
    paper describes the findings and outlines recommendations for a revised future
    version of the SLD and SE standards that resolves these issues.\r\n"
