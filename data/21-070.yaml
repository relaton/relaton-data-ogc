abstract:
- content: Methane (CH4) is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and the comparative
    impact of methane is 25 times greater than CO2 over a 100-year period. Methane
    is an invisible and odorless gas, and it is very labor intensive and time consuming
    in order to detect and repair leaks. Regulations play a critical role in methane
    emissions reduction, and how methane emissions are detected, repaired, and managed
    is highly dependent on local regulations. This OGC Best Practice document defines
    a SensorThings API for fugitive methane emissions management.
