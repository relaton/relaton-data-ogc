abstract:
- content: "This Standard defines the open CityGML Conceptual Model for the storage
    and exchange of virtual 3D city models. The CityGML Conceptual Model is defined
    by a Unified Modeling Language (UML) object model. This UML model builds on the
    ISO Technical Committee 211 (ISO/TC 211) conceptual model standards for spatial
    and temporal data. Building on the ISO foundation assures that the man-made features
    described in the city models share the same spatiotemporal universe as the surrounding
    countryside within which they reside.\r\n\r\nA key goal for the development of
    the CityGML Conceptual Model is to provide a common definition of the basic entities,
    attributes, and relations of a 3D city model. This is especially important with
    respect to the cost-effective sustainable maintenance of 3D city models, allowing
    the reuse of the same data in different application fields.\r\n\r\nThe class models
    described in this standard are also available at https://github.com/opengeospatial/CityGML3-Workspace/tree/1.0/UML/CityGML"
