abstract:
- content: 'This document describes the 3D portrayal server components which were
    used in the OGC OWS-6 Decision Support Systems (DSS) thread. The objective pf
    this activity was to efficiently stream and display GML 3 content in internet
    or wireless networks with limited bandwidth, especially focusing on the CityGML
    application profile. The server for delivering landscape and city models is implemented
    as Web 3D Service (W3DS) that is designed as portrayal service. '
