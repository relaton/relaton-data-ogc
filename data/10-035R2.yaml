abstract:
- content: This Engineering Report describes an investigation and evaluation of various
    methods of sharing information within a collaborative environment accomplished
    during the OGC Web Services Testbed, Phase 7 (OWS-7). The intent of the OWS-7
    Information Sharing activity was to move toward a standardized method of sharing
    geospatial data between Integrated Clients and potentially catalogs. This report
    reviews past OGC work within this area, makes recommendations based on the best
    parts of previous collaboration techniques, and provides recommendations for encoding
    documents for use in information sharing.
