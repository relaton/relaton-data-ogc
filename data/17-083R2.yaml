abstract:
- content: 'The OGC Tile Matrix Set standard defines the rules and requirements for
    a tile matrix set as a way to index space based on a set of regular grids defining
    a domain (tile matrix) for a limited list of scales in a Coordinate Reference
    System (CRS) as defined in [OGC 08-015r2] Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial
    Referencing by Coordinates. Each tile matrix is divided into regular tiles. In
    a tile matrix set, a tile can be univocally identified by a tile column a tile
    row and a tile matrix identifier. This document presents a data structure defining
    the properties of the tile matrix set in both UML diagrams and in tabular form.
    This document also presents a data structure to define a subset of a tile matrix
    set called tile matrix set limits. XML and JSON encodings are suggested both for
    tile matrix sets and tile matrix set limits. Finally, the document offers practical
    examples of tile matrix sets both for common global projections and for specific
    regions.'
