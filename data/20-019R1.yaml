abstract:
- content: In Testbed-16, participants researched ways to mitigate these limitations,
    particularly in the context of the Ordnance Survey (OS) MasterMap Topography datasets.
    The Testbed activity also made use of OS Open Zoomstack, a smaller, freely available,
    multi-scale dataset. To address the first two limitations, Testbed participants
    developed GeoPackage metadata profiles designed to advance the discoverability
    of the contents of a GeoPackage and exchange the OS portrayal styles and symbols.
    The metadata proved to be interoperable between the server and client implementation.
