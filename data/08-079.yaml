abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the behavior of a service that provides transactions
    on and access to geographic features in a manner independent of the underlying
    data store. It specifies discovery operations, query operations and transaction
    operations. Discovery operations allow the service to be interrogated to determine
    its capabilities and to retrieve the application schema that defines the feature
    types that the service offers. Retrieval operations allow features to be retrieved
    from the opaque underlying data store based upon constraints on spatial and non-spatial
    feature properties defined by the client. Transaction operations allow features
    to be created, changed and deleted from the opaque underlying data store.
