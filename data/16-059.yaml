abstract:
- content: "This engineering report documents the findings of the activities related
    to the Semantic Portrayal, Registry and Mediation components implemented during
    the OGC Testbed 12. This effort is a continuation of efforts initiated in the
    OGC Testbed 11. This report provides an analysis of the different standards considered
    during this effort, documents the rendering endpoints extension added to the Semantic
    Portrayal Service and the migration of the Portrayal metadata to the Semantic
    Registry, which is aligned with the DCAT REST Service API. We also discuss the
    integration of the CSW ebRIM for Application Schema with the Semantic Mediation
    Service, and document the improvements of the SPARQL Extensions, Portrayal and
    Semantic Mediation ontologies defined in the previous testbed.\r\n\r\n"
