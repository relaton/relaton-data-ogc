abstract:
- content: This profile is based on the HTTP protocol binding described in Clause
    10 of the Catalogue 2.0.2 specification; it qualifies as a ‘Class 2’ profile under
    the terms of ISO 19106 since it includes extensions permitted within the context
    of the base specifications, some of which are not part of the ISO 19100 series
    of geomatics standards.
