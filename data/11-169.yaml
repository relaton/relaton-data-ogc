abstract:
- content: "This Discussion Paper describes a lightweight SOS 2.0 profile for stationary
    in-situ sensors. Besides the SOS itself this document also addresses the data
    formats used by the SOS: Observations & Measurements 2.0 (O&M) for encoding measurement
    data and the Sensor Model Language 2.0 (SensorML) for encoding metadata. Other
    SWE standards which provide more specialized functionality are not part of this
    minimum lightweight SWE profile.\r\nThe aim of this document is to present a common
    minimum profile of the SOS. The profile is intended to reduce the complexity of
    the standard by omitting highly specific elements that are not necessary for the
    majority of use cases that occur in practice. At the same time, the profile is
    designed in such a way that all SOS implementations that conform to this profile
    are also compliant to the according OGC specifications."
