abstract:
- content: "The CDB standard defines a standardized model and structure for a single,
    “versionable”, virtual representation of the earth. A CDB structured data store
    provides for a geospatial content and model definition repository that is plug-and-play
    interoperable between database authoring workstations.  Moreover, a CDB structured
    data store can be used as a common online (or runtime) repository from which various
    simulator client-devices can simultaneously retrieve and modify, in real-time,
    relevant information to perform their respective runtime simulation tasks. In
    this case, a CDB is plug-and-play interoperable between CDB-compliant simulators.
    \ A CDB can be readily used by existing simulation client-devices (legacy Image
    Generators, Radar simulator, Computer Generated Forces, etc.) through a data publishing
    process that is performed on-demand in real-time.\r\nThe application of CDB to
    future simulation architectures will significantly reduce runtime-source level
    and algorithmic correlation errors, while reducing development, update and configuration
    management timelines.  With the addition of the High Level Architecture - -Federation
    Object Model (HLA/FOM)  and DIS protocols, the application of the CDB standard
    provides a Common Environment to which inter-connected simulators share a common
    view of the simulated environment.\r\nThe CDB standard defines an open format
    for the storage, access and modification of a synthetic environment database.
    \ A synthetic environment is a computer simulation that represents activities
    at a high level of realism, from simulation of theaters of war to factories and
    manufacturing processes. These environments may be created within a single computer
    or a vast distributed network connected by local and wide area networks and augmented
    by super-realistic special effects and accurate behavioral models. SE allows visualization
    of and immersion into the environment being simulated . \r\nThis standard defines
    the organization and storage structure of a worldwide synthetic representation
    of the earth as well as the conventions necessary to support all of the subsystems
    of a full-mission simulator.  The standard makes use of several commercial and
    simulation data formats endorsed by leaders of the database tools industry. A
    series of associated OGC Best Practice documents define rules and guidelines for
    data representation of real world features.\r\n"
