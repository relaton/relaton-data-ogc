abstract:
- content: 'The OpenGIS® Geospatial eXtensible Access Control Markup Language Encoding
    Standard (GeoXACML) defines a geospatial extension to the OASIS standard “eXtensible
    Access Control Markup Language (XACML)” [www.oasis-open.org/committees/xacml/].
    This extension incorporates spatial data types and spatial authorization decision
    functions based on the OGC Simple Features[http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa]
    and GML[http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml] standards.  GeoXACML is a
    policy language that supports the declaration and enforcement of access rights
    across jurisdictions and can be used to implement interoperable access control
    systems for geospatial applications such as Spatial Data Infrastructures. GeoXACML
    is not designed to be a rights expression language and is therefore not an extension
    of the OGC GeoDRM Reference Model (Topic 18 in the OpenGIS® Abstract Specification
    [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/as]). '
