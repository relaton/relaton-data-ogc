abstract:
  content: "This International Standard specifies the behaviour of a service that
    provides transactions on and access to geographic features in a manner independent
    of the underlying data store. It specifies discovery operations, query operations,
    locking operations, transaction operations and operations to manage stored parameterized
    query expressions.\r\nDiscovery operations allow the service to be interrogated
    to determine its capabilities and to retrieve the application schema that defines
    the feature types that the service offers.\r\nQuery operations allow features
    or values of feature properties to be retrieved from the underlying data store
    based upon constraints, defined by the client, on feature properties.\r\nLocking
    operations allow exclusive access to features for the purpose of modifying or
    deleting features.\r\nTransaction operations allow features to be created, changed,
    replaced and deleted from the underlying data store.\r\nStored query operations
    allow clients to create, drop, list and described parameterized query expressions
    that are stored by the server and can be repeatedly invoked using different parameter
    values."
