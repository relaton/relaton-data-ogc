abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 17 Engineering Report (ER) analyses the Measures and
    Signatures Intelligence Enterprise Service Bus (MASBUS) pilot software and the
    efforts to integrate with OGC SensorThings API resources. After introducing MASBUS,
    a server implementation is designed to digest sensor data and demonstrate the
    SensorThings MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) extension of the MASBUS
    software. To show the SensorThings MQTT extension of the MASBUS software, a MASBUS
    client implementation is also presented. This ER discusses the results of the
    MASBUS integration, including all lessons learned from the experiments completed
    during the OGC Testbed 17 Sensor Integration thread and concludes with a set of
    optimum recommendations.\r\n\r\n"
