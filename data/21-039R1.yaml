abstract:
- content: "This Testbed-17 (TB-17) Aviation API Engineering Report (ER) summarizes
    the implementations, findings and recommendations that emerged from the efforts
    of building a definition for an Aviation API compliant with the requirements of
    the OGC Standards Program, and the exploration of the potential of aviation data
    fusion.\r\n\r\nThis ER describes the nine façades built to interface SWIM services
    and serve aviation data through OGC APIs, the two services built to consume SWIM
    data and fuse it to generate richer datasets while serving the fused data through
    OGC APIs, the client application built to display data retrieved from the façades
    and fusion services, and the development client built to focus on functionality
    and experimentation.\r\n\r\nFinally, this ER discusses the potential of OGC APIs
    to help standardize the access to aviation data within the context of the System
    Wide Information Management (SWIM) program."
