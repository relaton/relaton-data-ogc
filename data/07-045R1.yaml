abstract:
- content: "Catalogue services are the key technology for locating, managing and maintaining\r\ndistributed
    geo-resources (i.e. geospatial data, applications and services). With OGC\r\ncatalogue
    services, client applications are capable of searching for geo-resources in a\r\nstandardized
    way (i.e. through standardized interfaces and operations) and, ideally, they\r\nare
    based on a well-known information model, which includes spatial references and\r\nfurther
    descriptive (thematic) information that enables client applications to search
    for\r\ngeo-resources in very efficient ways.\r\nWhereas interfaces and operations
    of OGC catalogue services are well defined, it is left\r\nup to the developer
    of the system to define a specific information model which a\r\ncatalogue service
    instance provides. This includes, but is not limited to, the information\r\nwhich
    can be inserted in the catalog, supported query languages, available search terms,\r\nresponse/result
    sets, etc. This point is of major importance with respect to interoperability\r\nbetween
    different catalogue service instances.\r\nIn Europe, running catalogue instances
    result from work being done within different SDI\r\ninitiatives (e.g. SDI NRW
    Initiative1, Germany/Netherlands cross-border initiative, JRC\r\nEU Portal, EUROSTAT,
    Inspire, German SDI initiative). Members of these initiatives\r\nhave developed
    an ISO-based application profile for ISO19115 metadata for\r\ngeodata/geospatial
    applications and ISO19119-based metadata for tightly and looselycoupled\r\ngeospatial
    services. The foundations of this profile were the OGC catalogue\r\nspecification
    (1.1.1), the OGC Web Registry Server (WRS) 0.0.2, OGC Web Services\r\nStateless
    Catalogue Profile (StCS) 0.0.6 and ISO 19115/19119 for content description.\r\nOGC's
    catalogue revision working group (CS-RWG) has revised and integrated the\r\ncatalogue
    implementation specification v1.1.1 that have resulted in CS 2.0.2. One part of\r\nthis
    OGC specification comprises the definition of application profiles according to
    ISO\r\n19106 (Geographic information – Profiles). The overall goal of these profiles
    is to\r\nimprove interoperability between systems conforming to a specific profile.
    Experience\r\nhas shown that the need for application profiles results from the
    fact that in practice, there\r\nis no single solution for catalogue services that
    fits every user’s needs. As stated in CS\r\n2.0.2, a base profile that provides
    a basic set of information objects has to be supported\r\nby each catalogue instance;
    in addition, application profiles for different information\r\ncommunities can
    be specified.\r\nHence, this document specifies an application profile for ISO
    19115:2003/ISO\r\n19119:2005 metadata with support for XML encoding per ISO/TS19139:2007
    [ISO/TS19139]2 and HTTP protocol binding. It relies on requirements coming from
    the\r\nCS/CSW 2.0 specification (OGC CS 2.0.2, OGC document 07-006). The application\r\nprofile
    will form the basis of conformance tests and reference implementations."
