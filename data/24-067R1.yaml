abstract:
- content: "This initiative addresses the challenges of data interoperability and
    multi-system integration within Urban Digital Twins (UDTs). It explores the development
    and interoperability of various modules within an Urban Digital Twin (UDT) framework,
    leveraging OGC standards to enable seamless data exchange and communication.\r\n\r\nThe
    effort focuses on two key applications: noise modeling and Geo-AI analysis.\r\n\r\nFor
    noise modeling, the program utilizes 3D city models in CityGML format, traffic
    profiles, and noise sensor readings. This data is used to simulate and visualize
    noise levels in urban environments, supporting urban planning and management decisions
    aimed at mitigating noise pollution.\r\n\r\nFor Geo-AI analysis, the undertaking
    processes camera imagery, INS metadata, and labeled training data. This data is
    converted into formats such as GeoPose and TrainingDML to support machine learning
    tasks like object detection (e.g., identifying obstacles or illegal dumping) and
    road surface classification.\r\n\r\nThe initiative employs various OGC APIs for
    data access and processing, ensuring interoperability across modules. Key outcomes
    include the development of prototype APIs, workflows, and visualization tools
    that demonstrate the value of OGC standards in building a robust and interoperable
    UDT ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis project also emphasizes the importance of stakeholder
    engagement, involving sponsors such as the Land and Housing Agency of Korea and
    user groups like the United Nations, to ensure the practical relevance of the
    UDT applications.\r\n\r\nAlthough the current focus is on two applications, the
    framework is designed to be extensible, allowing for additional or alternative
    applications in the future and aims to serve as a reference framework for building
    UDTs using OGC standards.\r\n\r\n"
