abstract:
- content: "The Open Science Persistent Demonstrator (OSPD) is a collaborative initiative
    led by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), in partnership with the European
    Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
    Its primary goal is to advance open science by enabling reproducible Earth Science
    research across global communities.\r\n\r\nKey Objectives:\r\n\r\nPromote Open
    Science: Facilitate broader access to Earth Observation (EO) data and tools, encouraging
    cross-disciplinary research and informed decision-making.\r\nEnhance Interoperability:
    Test and demonstrate the integration of diverse Earth Observation and Earth Science
    cloud technologies and infrastructures developed by ESA, NASA, and other international
    organizations.\r\nDevelop a Persistent Demonstrator: Create a 24/7 web application
    that showcases scientific workflows across multiple platforms, demonstrating how
    different organizations’ platforms can be utilized for collaborative research
    and data representation.\r\n"
