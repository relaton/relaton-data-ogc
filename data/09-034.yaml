abstract:
- content: This document discusses considerations about and recommendations for approaches
    for georeferenceable imagery under the Sensor Web Enablement thread during OGC
    Web Services Phase 6. This is an extension to the work described in the previous
    engineering report number OGC 08-071 . Georeferencealbe imagery is “a referenceable
    grid that has information that can be used to transform grid coordinates to external
    coordinates, but the transformation shall not be required to be an affine transformation”.
    Geolocation of georeferenceable imagery refers to the techniques described in
    ISO 19130, such as sensor models, functional fit models, and spatial registration
    using control points.
