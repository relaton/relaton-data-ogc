abstract:
- content: "The OpenGIS® Geography Markup Language Encoding Standard (GML) The Geography
    Markup Language (GML) is an XML grammar for expressing geographical features.
    GML serves as a modeling language for geographic systems as well as an open interchange
    format for geographic transactions on the Internet. As with most XML based grammars,
    there are two parts to the grammar – the schema that describes the document and
    the instance document that contains the actual data.\r\nA GML document is described
    using a GML Schema. This allows users and developers to describe generic geographic
    data sets that contain points, lines and polygons. However, the developers of
    GML envision communities working to define community-specific application schemas
    [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GML_Application_Schemas] that are specialized extensions
    of GML. Using application schemas, users can refer to roads, highways, and bridges
    instead of points, lines and polygons. If everyone in a community agrees to use
    the same schemas they can exchange data easily and be sure that a road is still
    a road when they view it.\r\n\r\nClients and servers with interfaces that implement
    the OpenGIS® Web Feature Service Interface Standard[http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs]
    read and write GML data. GML is also an ISO standard (ISO 19136:2007) [www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=32554
    ].  \r\n"
