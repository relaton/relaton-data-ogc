abstract:
- content: "This Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard defines the conceptual
    model for the OGC CDB Standard. The objective of this document is to provide an
    abstract core conceptual model for a CDB data store (repository). The model is
    represented using UML (unified modeling language). The conceptual model is comprised
    of concepts, schema, classes and categories as well as their relationships, which
    are used to understand, and/or represent an OGC CDB data store. This enables a
    comparison and description of the CDB data store structure on a more detailed
    level. This document was created by reverse-engineering the UML diagrams and documentation
    from the original CDB submission  as a basis for supporting OGC interoperability.
    One of the important roles of this conceptual model is to provide a UML model
    that is consistent with the other OGC standards and to identify functional gaps
    between the current CDB data store and the OGC standards baseline.  This document
    references sections of Volume 1: OGC CDB Core Standard: Model and Physical Database
    Structure [OGC 15-113r5].\r\n\r\nNOTE: The simulation community uses the term
    “synthetic environment data” to mean all the digital data stored in some database
    or structured data store that is required for use by simulation clients. From
    the geospatial community perspective, these data are essentially the same as GIS
    data but with, in some cases, special attributes, such as radar reflectivity.\r\n"
