abstract:
- content: "OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable
    Web APIs in a consistent way. The OpenAPI specification is used to define the
    API building blocks.\r\n\r\nThe OGC API family of standards is organized by resource
    type. This standard specifies the fundamental API building blocks for interacting
    with features. The spatial data community uses the term 'feature' for things in
    the real world that are of interest."
