abstract:
- content: "The provenance activities reported in this document were part of the OGC
    Testbed 10\r\nCross Community Interoperability (CCI) thread. This OGC® document
    gives guidelines\r\nfor the capture and documentation of provenance information
    at dataset, feature and\r\nattribute level. It only considers vector features
    (mainly, points and lines) and does not\r\nelaborate on the coverage data model
    (so it does not talk about provenance of raster\r\ninformation). It proposes an
    approach to use the W3C PROV standard with geospatial\r\ninformation that can
    come from different sources and are integrated through different\r\nprocessing
    steps. It also reviews the applicability of ISO19115 and ISO19115-2 lineage."
