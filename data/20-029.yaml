abstract:
- content: This OGC Engineering Report documents the goals, activities, experiences,
    and outcomes of the 3D Data Container and Tiles API Pilot. Participants in the
    Pilot cooperatively defined a GeoVolume (3D Geospatial Volume) resource and developed
    a GeoVolumes API based on the concept to provide access to different 2D and 3D
    geospatial dataset distributions organized by region of interest. Multiple client
    and server implementations of the GeoVolumes API successfully carried out technology
    interchange experiments that demonstrated the value of the API for improving interoperability
    between 3D geospatial data formats.
