abstract:
- content: "“The cloud is dead – long live the cloud!” so begins an IEC White paper
    on Edge Intelligence.[1]  The IEC White Paper continues that “Driven by the internet
    of things (IoT), a new computing model – edge-cloud computing – is currently evolving,
    which involves extending data processing to the edge of a network in addition
    to computing in a cloud or a central data centre. Edge-Fog-Cloud computing models
    operate both on premise and in public and private clouds, including via devices,
    base stations, edge servers, micro data centres and networks.” "
