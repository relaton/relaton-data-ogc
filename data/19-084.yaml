abstract:
- content: "The OGC Vector Tiles Pilot 2: Vector Tiles Filtering Language Engineering
    Report (ER) defines a filter language for vector data delivered as tiles (also
    known as vector tiles). The language applies to vector tiles served through implementations
    of the OGC API â€“ Features standard and the draft OGC API - Tiles specification,
    but can be generally applied on all services supporting filtering by attributes.\r\n\r\nThe
    ER further includes an assessment of filter languages, styles and online/offline
    symbol sharing for GeoPackages, OGC API - Features and OGC API - Tiles implementations
    for accuracy and completeness in applications that render vector tiles at local
    to regional scales."
