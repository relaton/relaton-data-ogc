abstract:
- content: 'This standard currently defines eight packages with data types for common
    use across OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) services. Five of these packages define
    operation request and response types. The packages are: 1.) Contents – Defines
    data types that can be used in specific services that provide (access to) sensors;
    2.) Notification – Defines the data types that support provision of metadata about
    the notification capabilities of a service as well as the definition and encoding
    of SWES events; 3.) Common - Defines data types common to other packages; 4.)
    Common Codes –Defines commonly used lists of codes with special semantics; 5.)
    DescribeSensor – Defines the request and response types of an operation used to
    retrieve metadata about a given sensor; 6.) UpdateSensorDescription –Defines the
    request and response types of an operation used to modify the description of a
    given sensor; 7.) InsertSensor – Defines the request and response types of an
    operation used to insert a new sensor instance at a service; 8.) DeleteSensor
    – Defines the request and response types of an operation used to remove a sensor
    from a service. These packages use data types specified in other standards. Those
    data types are normatively referenced herein, instead of being repeated in this
    standard.'
