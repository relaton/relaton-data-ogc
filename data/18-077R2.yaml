abstract:
- content: This paper offers the results of research, design, and prototype efforts
    to present the OGC standards working group an approach to creating “GeoCDB”—a
    technology mashing of GeoPackage and OGC CDB—as a deterministic repository of
    easily read data geospatial datasets suitable for storage, runtime access, and
    dissemination for live, virtual, constructive, gaming, and mission command (MC)
    systems.
