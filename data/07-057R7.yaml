abstract:
- content: This Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) Implementation Standard provides a standard
    based solution to serve digital maps using predefined image tiles. The service
    advertises the tiles it has available through a standardized declaration in the
    ServiceMetadata document common to all OGC web services. This declaration defines
    the tiles available in each layer (i.e. each type of content), in each graphical
    representation style, in each format, in each coordinate reference system, at
    each scale, and over each geographic fragment of the total covered area. The ServiceMetadata
    document also declares the communication protocols and encodings through which
    clients can interact with the server. Clients can interpret the ServiceMetadata
    document to request specific tiles.
