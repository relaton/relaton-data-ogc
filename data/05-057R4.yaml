abstract:
- content: The services proposed in this profile are intended to support the identification
    and subsequent ordering of EO data products from previously identified data collections.
    The intent of this initial profile is to describe a minimum interface that can
    be supported by many data providers (satellite operators, data distributors...),
    most of whom have existing (and relatively complex) facilities for the management
    of these data.
