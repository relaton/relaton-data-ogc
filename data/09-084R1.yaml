abstract:
- content: The OpenSearch specification originates in a community effort built around
    Amazon's A9.com. It was intended to allow syndication of search results that could
    then be aggregated by one large index. The OpenSearch specification is made available
    under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 2.5 license. In addition, the
    OASIS Search Web Services group is publishing an Abstract Protocol Definition
    of the interface or “binding”, which coincides with the community specification
    published at http://opensearch.org. In 2007, Andrew Turner proposed a set of geospatial
    extensions through OpenSearch.org.
