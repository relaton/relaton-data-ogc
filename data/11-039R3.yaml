abstract:
- content: "Common semantics support the reference of features to the concept they
    represent and the integration of data proceed using the semantic framework such
    mappings provide. However there is no standard conceptual model for hydrologic
    feature identification. Different models of hydrologic processes, and different
    scales of detail, lead to a variety of information models to describe these features,
    and to different and mostly incompatible sets of feature identifiers. \r\nThis
    document describes requirements and a proposed design for a domain model of hydrologic
    features as a set of interrelated Application Schemas using the ISO 19109 General
    Feature Model, \r\n"
