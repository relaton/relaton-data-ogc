abstract:
- content: The Event Pattern Markup Language (EML) allows one to describe event patterns
    for event (stream) processing and analysis. It can be used to build multi stage
    filters for incoming events but also to derive higher information through combining
    and correlating multiple events. It can be applied on single events but is focused
    on handling of continuous event streams.
