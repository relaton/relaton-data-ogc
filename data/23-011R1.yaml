abstract:
- content: "With the growing commercialization of space there is a need to look beyond
    the earth and explore the integration of sensors or assets in celestial orbits
    or in free flight in our solar system. Their exact tracking and localization are
    becoming increasingly important as space emerges as the newest area in need for
    standard-based mechanisms for streaming and for data integration from various
    sensors.\r\n\r\nThis Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Testbed 18 3D+ Data Space
    Object Engineering Report (ER) describes existing standards in terms of their
    ability to represent a suite of multidimensional Coordinate Reference Systems
    (CRS) and associated geometries as well as identifies shortfalls in these standards."
