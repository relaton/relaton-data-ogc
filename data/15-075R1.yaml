abstract:
- content: This OGC Discussion Paper provides a navigation use-case for the use of
    IndoorGML for mobile location services (MLS). In particular, the Discussion Paper
    explains how the OGC IndoorGML standard can be applied to a MLS application for
    visually impaired people in indoor space. Finally, a prototype development of
    the application on Android smart phone is described in this report.
