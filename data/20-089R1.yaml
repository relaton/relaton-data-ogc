abstract:
- content: "Platforms for the exploitation of Earth Observation (EO) data have been
    developed by public and private companies in order to foster the usage of EO data
    and expand the market of Earth Observation-derived information. A fundamental
    principle of the platform operations concept is to move the EO data processing
    service’s user to the data and tools, as opposed to downloading, replicating,
    and exploiting data ‘at home’. In this scope, previous OGC activities initiated
    the development of an architecture to allow the ad-hoc deployment and execution
    of applications close to the physical location of the source data with the goal
    to minimize data transfer between data repositories and application processes.\r\n\r\nThis
    document defines the Best Practice to package and deploy Earth Observation Applications
    in an Exploitation Platform. The document is targeting the implementation, packaging
    and deployment of EO Applications in support of collaborative work processes between
    developers and platform owners.\r\n\r\nThe Best Practice includes recommendations
    for the application design patterns, package encoding, container and data interfaces
    for data stage-in and stage-out strategies focusing on three main viewpoints:
    Application, Package and Platform."
