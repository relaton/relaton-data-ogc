abstract:
- content: "This Discussion Paper proposes model for license-based access control
    to SOAP services, based on OASIS SAML 2.0. This approach is a potential solution
    for license-based access control, which requires the possession of a valid license
    for getting access to a service. Use of digital licenses allow users to act on
    or with web services to which they are associated\r\n\r\nThis document re-uses
    content produced by the OGC GeoRM Common 1.0 Standards Working Group and combined
    that with the document OGC 10-125, which was posted to an internal OGC document
    archive (Pending Documents) but is not publicly available.\r\nThis document does
    not claim compliance to the GeoDRM reference model (ISO 19153), although the authors
    are not yet aware of any conflicts to it.\r\n"
