abstract:
- content: "The OGC Testbed-18 initiative included a discussion exploring the future
    of open science and building energy interoperability with the task of developing
    a set of best practices to make the data processing services of Exploitation Platforms
    both reproducible and follow the FAIR data principles.\r\n\r\nPortability and
    reproducibility are key factors for the long-term scientific impact of Earth Observation
    (EO) data processing applications provided by Exploitations Platforms. The EO
    application developers lack the tools and guidance to preserve all the elements,
    algorithms, software, and data resources used to produce the results. Without
    these elements, reproducibility becomes resubmission within the platform and only
    while the same platform resources such as data are preserved and available.\r\n\r\nThis
    Testbed 18 Engineering Report defines a list of requirements and respective best
    practices to support reproducible Earth Observation science covering the different
    resources of the Earth Observation Exploitation Platforms such as publications,
    data, services, products, information, software, or computing environments.\r\n\r\n"
