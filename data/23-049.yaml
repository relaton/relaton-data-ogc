abstract:
- content: "The primary goal of the Abstract Conceptual Model for Time is to establish
    clear concepts, their relationships, and terminology.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental concepts
    of events, clocks, timescales, coordinates and calendars have been long established,
    but there is no clear, straightforward defining document. This Abstract Specification
    provides clear consistent definitions of the fundamental concepts and terminology.
    The conceptual model enables advantages and disadvantages of adopting a particular
    technological approach to be identified and provides an opportunity for communities
    to build consistent, interoperable representations regardless of implementation.\r\n\r\nTraditionally,
    geospatial communities used 2D coordinates and the vertical (third dimension)
    and temporal aspects were considered attributes rather than valid components of
    coordinate systems. In an increasingly dynamic, faster and multidimensional world,
    much confusion and lack of interoperability has occurred because of inconsistent
    approaches to defining and expressing time. Various international bodies expended
    considerable effort to establish the Gregorian Calendar as a consistent timeline.
    The Gregorian Calendar suffices for low precision applications, such as to the
    nearest minute, but not so when second or sub-second accuracy is required. For
    example, there have been differing practices and no consensus on whether leap
    seconds should be part of the Gregorian timeline.\r\n\r\nThis document is consistent
    with ISO 19111:2019 and W3C Time Ontology in OWL."
