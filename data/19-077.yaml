abstract:
- content: The OGC Body of Knowledge is a structured collection of concepts and related
    resources that can be found in the OGC library. It is, in effect, a view of explicit
    knowledge available from the OGC Virtual Knowledge Store and related components
    such as the OGC Definitions Server and the OGC Glossary of Terms. The OGC Body
    of Knowledge is intended to provide a reference for users and developers of geospatial
    software. This discussion paper describes the approach taken to develop the OGC
    Body of Knowledge and presents the results of the approach. It is intended to
    encourage and facilitate discussion within the OGC membership and wider geospatial
    community.
