abstract:
- content: The requirement for capabilities supporting semantic understanding and
    reasoning in geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) is an all-encompassing paradigm
    shift from the past. Standards play a critical role in ensuring this is accomplished
    in a consistent and repeatable manner. Semantic standards and services supporting
    semantic capabilities are at a relatively early stage of development. Interoperability
    between semantic standards for encoding relationships and Web based services for
    discovery, access, retrieval and visualization of those relationships requires
    more testing and evaluation. This engineering report (ER) highlights the key findings
    and discussions from Testbed-12 that enable semantic interoperability, including
    semantic mediation, schema registries, and SPARQL endpoints. It references key
    findings from the Semantic Portrayal ER and helps to understand the current OGC
    discussion on semantics in general.
