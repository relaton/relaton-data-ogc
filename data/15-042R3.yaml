abstract:
- content: TimeseriesML 1.0 defines an XML encoding that implements the OGC Timeseries
    Profile of Observations and Measurements [OGC 15-043r3], with the intent of allowing
    the exchange of such data sets across information systems. Through the use of
    existing OGC standards, it aims at being an interoperable exchange format that
    may be re-used to address a range of data exchange requirements.
