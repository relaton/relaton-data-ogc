abstract:
- content: This document presents the requirements for defining the Symbology Conceptual
    Core Model (SymCore), the conceptual basis to define symbology rules for the portrayal
    of geographical data. It is modular and extensible (one core model, many extensions),
    also encoding agnostic (one symbology model, many encodings). It contains a minimal
    set of abstract classes representing explicit extension points of the model.
