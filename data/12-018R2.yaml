abstract:
- content: 'This report describes the methods, results, issues and recommendations
    generated by the Surface Water Interoperability Experiment (SW IE), carried out
    as an activity of the OGC Hydrology Domain Working Group (HDWG). The SW IE was
    designed to advance the development of WaterML 2.0 and test its use with various
    OGC service standards (SOS, WFS, WMS and CSW). A secondary aim was to contribute
    to the development of a hydrology domain feature model and vocabularies, which
    are essential for interoperability in the hydrology domain, although these are
    not the main focus for the IE. '
