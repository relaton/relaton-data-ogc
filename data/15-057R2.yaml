abstract:
- content: This OGC Engineering Report (ER) was created as a deliverable for the OGC
    Testbed 11 initiative of the OGC Interoperability Program. This ER describes an
    approach for incorporating Social Media for Emergency Response applications that
    use spatial data infrastructures. This document also reports on findings about
    the advancements using Social Media and VGI resources. The ER includes ideas on
    improving the architecture, service change recommendations (primarily concerning
    the OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS) 2.0 interface), and lessons learned.
