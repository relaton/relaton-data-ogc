abstract:
- content: This OGC Disaster Pilot â€™23 (DP23) Engineering Report summarizes technical
    work done in the Pilot to increase drought and wildfires awareness among various
    disaster management stakeholders. Pilot participants implemented components of
    a data flow ecosystem to leverage analysis-ready earth observations and other
    datasets (ARD) and produce decision-ready indicators (DRI) according to collaboratively
    developed workflow recipes. DP23 focused on the hazards of drought, wildfires,
    and floods, the interactions and complications among them, as well as climate
    change scenario effects on hydropower production, in regions of Canada, United
    States, and Italy. The Pilot also prototyped providing information to field practitioners
    in secure package formats and leveraging linked data and structured web page information
    to optimize public web searches for disaster information.
