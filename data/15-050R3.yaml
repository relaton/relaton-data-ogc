abstract:
- content: "The goal of the Geo4NIEM thread in Testbed 11 was to gain Intelligence
    Community\r\n(IC) concurrence of the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)
    Version 3.0\r\narchitecture through the development, implementations, test, and
    robust demonstration\r\nmaking use of IC specifications, Geography Markup Language
    (GML), and NIEM in a\r\nsimulated “real-world” scenario. The demonstration scenario
    begins with NIEMconformant\r\nInformation Exchange Packages (IEPs) containing
    operational data and IC\r\nsecurity tags from the Information Security Marking
    (ISM) and Need-To-Know (NTK)\r\naccess control metadata, and the Trusted Data
    Format (TDF) for binding assertion\r\nmetadata with data resource(s). Those instance
    documents are deployed using Open\r\nGeospatial Consortium (OGC) standards enabled
    Web Services for use by client\r\napplications. Access control is based on attributes
    of the end-user and the instance data.\r\nRecommendations to update these information
    exchanges were provided to reflect NIEM\r\n3.0 architecture and security tags
    in a ‘NIEM/IC Data Encoding’. The assessment tested\r\nthis data encoding in OGC
    Web Feature Services (WFS) and Policy Enforcement Points\r\n(PEP) accessed by
    multiple client applications. Results from this task provided a\r\npreliminary
    architecture that was tested and demonstrated in Testbed 11, and summarized\r\nin
    other OGC Testbed 11 Engineering Reports. The demonstrations also highlighted
    how\r\nNIEM and IC data encodings together may support more agile and customer-centric\r\nframeworks
    driven by collaborative partnerships. This transformation is vital to\r\nconfronting
    the security challenges of the future."
