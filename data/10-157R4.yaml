abstract:
- content: "This OGC Implementation Standard defines a profile of Observations and
    Measurements (ISO 19156:2010 and OGC 10-025r1) for describing Earth Observation
    products (EO products).\r\nThis profile is intended to provide a standard schema
    for encoding Earth Observation product metadata to support the description and
    cataloguing of products from sensors aboard EO satellites.  \r\nThe metadata being
    defined in this document is applicable in a number of places where EO product
    metadata is needed.\r\n1.\tIn the EO Product Extension Package for ebRIM (OGC
    10-189). This extension package defines how to catalog Earth Observation product
    metadata described by this document. Using this metadata model and the Catalogue
    Service defined in OGC 10-189, client applications can provide the functionality
    to discover EO Products.  Providing an efficient encoding for EO Product metadata
    cataloguing and discovery is the prime purpose of this specification.\r\n2.\tIn
    the EO Application Profile of WMS (OGC 07-063r1). The GetFeatureInfo operation
    on the outline (footprint layer) should return metadata following the Earth Observation
    Metadata profile of Observation and Measurements.\r\n3.\tIn a coverage downloaded
    via an EO WCS AP (OGC 10-140). In WCS 2.0 (OGC 10-084), the GetCoverage and DescribeCoverage
    response contains the metadata element intended to store metadata information
    about the coverage. The Earth Observation Application profile of WCS (OGC 10-140)
    specifies that the metadata format preferred for Earth Observation is defined
    by this document.\r\n4.\tPotentially enclosed within an actual product to describe
    georeferencing information as for instance within the JPEG2000 format using GMLJP2.
    GMLJP2 defines how to store GML coverage metadata inside a JP2 file.  \r\nEarth
    Observation data products are generally managed within logical collections that
    are usually structured to contain data items derived from sensors onboard a satellite
    or series of satellites.  The key characteristics differentiating products within
    the collections are date of acquisition, location as well as characteristics depending
    on the type of sensor, For example, key characteristics for optical imagery are
    the possible presence of cloud, haze, smokes or other atmospheric or on ground
    phenomena obscuring the image. \r\nThe common metadata used to distinguish EO
    products types are presented in this document for generic and thematic EO products
    (i.e optical, radar, atmospheric, altimetry, limb-looking and synthesis and systematic
    products). From these metadata the encodings are derived according to standard
    schemas. In addition, this document describes the mechanism used to extend these
    schemas to specific missions and for specific purposes such as long term data
    preservation. \r\n"
