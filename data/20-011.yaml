abstract:
- content: This engineering report (ER) captures Smart City Interoperability Reference
    Architecture (SCIRA) Pilot implementation outcomes and findings to demonstrate
    the risk mitigation and safety capability of the SCIRA interoperable and standard-based
    architecture. SCIRA Pilot is an OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) Innovation Program
    project sponsored by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science & Technology
    (S&T) in collaboration with the city of St. Louis, Missouri. The purpose of this
    project is to advance standards for smart and safe cities and develop open, interoperable
    design patterns for incorporating the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors into city
    services.
