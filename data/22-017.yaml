abstract:
- content: This OGC Testbed 18 Engineering Report (ER) documents work to develop a
    foundation for future standardization of Training Datasets (TDS) for Earth Observation
    (EO) applications. The work performed in the Testbed 18 activity is based on previous
    OGC Machine Learning (ML) activities. TDS are essential to ML models, supporting
    accurate predictions in performing the desired task. However, a historical absence
    of standards has resulted in inconsistent and heterogeneous TDSs with limited
    discoverability and interoperability. Therefore, there is a need for best practices
    and guidelines for generating, structuring, describing, and curating TDSs that
    would include developing example software/packages to support these activities.
    Community and parallel OGC activities are working on these topics. This ER reviews
    those activities in parallel with making recommendations.
