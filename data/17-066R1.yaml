abstract:
- content: 'The “GeoPackage Extension for Tiled Gridded Coverage Data” extension (previously
    titled Elevation Extension) defines how to encode and store tiled regular gridded
    data, such as a digital elevation model, in a GeoPackage. In the ISO 19123 Schema
    for Coverage Geometry standard and in the OGC Coverage Implementation Schema,
    this type of regular gridded data is classed as grid-regular[1]. The tiles contain
    values, such as elevation, temperature or pressure, and may be stored as 16-bit
    PNG files or 32-bit TIFF files. The extension defines two ancillary data tables:
    one for regular gridded coverages and one for tiles. When using the PNG encoding,
    a scale and offset may be applied. The extension also allows for a TIFF encoding
    but constrains many of the TIFF options that are available to simplify development.'
