abstract:
- content: "In the context of a generic Earth Observation Exploitation Platform ecosystem,
    populated by Thematic Exploitation Platforms (TEPs) and Mission Exploitation Platforms
    (MEPs), which make use of cloud computing resources for Earth Observation data
    processing, the European Space Agency (ESA) has established two fundamental building
    blocks within a TEP, with different functions, the Application Deployment and
    Execution Service (ADES) and the Execution Management Service (EMS). Users interact
    with a TEP using a Web Client and the TEP contains an EMS and an ADES. The EMS
    includes most of the control logic, required for deploying and executing applications
    in different MEPs and TEPs while the ADES instead is responsible for the single
    application deployment and execution on a specific platform (i.e. TEP and/or MEP).\r\n\r\nThe
    D009 - ADES and EMS Results and Best Practices Engineering Report describes how
    the two services should be engineered in the Exploitation Platform context.\r\n\r\nThis
    Engineering Report (ER) describes the work performed by the Participants in the
    Exploitation Platforms Earth Observation Clouds (EOC) Thread of OGC Testbed-14
    concerning the interfaces proposed for the Authentication, Authorization, Billing
    and Quoting topics associated to the EMS and the ADES components."
