abstract:
  content: "The Incident Management Information Sharing (IMIS) Internet of Things
    (IoT) Pilot established the following objectives.\r\n•\tApply Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) principles and practices for collaborative development to existing
    standards and technology to prototype an IoT approach to sensor use for incident
    management. \r\n•\tEmploy an agile methodology for collaborative development of
    system designs, specifications, software and hardware components of an IoT-inspired
    IMIS sensor capability. \r\n•\tDevelop profiles and extensions of existing Sensor
    Web Enablement (SWE) and other distributed computing standards to provide a basis
    for future IMIS sensor and observation interoperability. \r\n•\tPrototype capabilities
    documented in engineering reports and demonstrated in a realistic incident management
    scenario. \r\n"
