abstract:
- content: This document is an Engineering Report for the OWS-9 Interoperability Test
    Bed. The focus of the document is discussion and demonstration on the use of SWE
    Common Data 2.0 encodings to support an interoperable messaging description and
    encoding for the next generation GPS message streams into and out of the GPS navigation
    accuracy improvement services. The connection of SWE Common to SensorML 2.0 and
    the application of SensorML to describe the processing surrounding GPS navigation
    improvement will also be discussed.
