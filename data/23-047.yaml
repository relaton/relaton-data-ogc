abstract:
- content: "OGC Testbed-19 has continued and furthered an ongoing discussion about
    how to interact with GeoDataCubes (GDC) in the most interoperable way (see Chapter
    1 for more Introduction). Testbed 19 participants produced a draft OGC GDC API
    standard that incorporates the most relevant developments in the field in and
    outside of OGC. This work advanced the common understanding of available solutions
    while discovering to a much better degree the advantages and drawbacks of current
    solutions. Testbed 19 participants produced prototypes of five back-end implementations
    and six client implementations as well as an automated test suite, which are described
    in full detail in Chapter 4. Many of the researched solutions are also available
    as open source and hence offer a perfect starting point for further GDC activities.\r\n\r\nThe
    main technologies that were evaluated in Testbed 19 included the OGC API Standards
    suite1, the openEO API2 and the Spatiotemporal Asset Catalog3 (STAC) specification.
    Based on cross walk comparisons (see Chapter 2), a unified draft GDC API was developed
    integrating as much as possible the existing solutions. openEO is largely compliant
    with the OGC API- Common Standard. As such, the openEO API specification provided
    the foundation for defining a draft OGC GDC API draft standard. During the Testbed
    19 period, more building blocks from the OCG API were incorporated into the draft
    GDC API document. These building blocks included parts of OGC API — Common, OGC
    API — Coverages, and OGC API – Processes. There is also future potential for visualization
    services through maps or tiles or even including components or elements of the
    OGC Web Services suite of Standards, such as WMS, WMTS, WCS, etc.\r\n\r\nThe current
    version of the draft GDC API, described in D71 of T19, supports different scenarios
    enabling implementations of the draft standard to offer only minimal support for
    data access with minimal manipulation of the data. Minimal manipulation is in
    terms of subsetting and reprojecting or including more advanced processing capabilities
    by incorporating building blocks from the openEO specification or from the OGC
    API — Processes – Part 1: Core Standard. Chapter 3 gives an overview of the draft
    standard.\r\n\r\nThe interaction capabilities between the different servers and
    clients developed are described in Chapter 5 and first impressions on usability
    in Chapter 6.\r\n\r\nFuture work could include the ability to link two processing
    options into one “integrated” option that supports either submitting openEO process
    graphs to a OGC API – Processes endpoint (extending and working on Processes — Part
    3), or supports integration of an OGC API – Processes process in the process graph
    of openEO through an extended concept of user defined functions in openEO. Further
    discussion is also needed on the pros and cons of including authentication in
    the draft standard. More details about lessons learned and suggestions can be
    found in Chapters 7 and 8 of this ER."
