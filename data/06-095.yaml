abstract:
- content: " A service by which a client may conduct asynchronous dialogues (message
    interchanges) with one or more other services. This service is useful when many
    collaborating services are required to satisfy a client request, and/or when significant
    delays are involved is satisfying the request. This service was defined under
    OWS 1.2 in support of SPS operations. WNS has broad applicability in many such
    multi-service applications. It is now used in several SWE scenarios."
