abstract:
- content: 'The Web View Service (WVS) is an extendable, interactive, image-based
    portrayal service for complex three-dimensional geodata such as 3D landscape and
    city models. 3D geodata is delivered as finally rendered images. Besides color
    images, relevant thematic and geometrical information such as object identity
    information or depth data is provided. Additionally, the WVS supports interaction
    with the portrayed 3D environment, e.g., information retrieval, spatial analysis,
    and 3D navigation. '
