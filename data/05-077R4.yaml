abstract:
- content: 'The OpenGISÂ® Symbology Encoding Standard (SES) defines an XML language
    for styling information that can be applied to digital geographic feature and
    coverage data. SE is independent of any OGC Web Services descriptions and could
    therefore be used to describe styling information in non-networked systems such
    as desktop geographic information systems. '
