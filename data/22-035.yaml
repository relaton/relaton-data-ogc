abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 18 3D Plus Data Standards and Streaming Engineering Report
    (ER) reviews existing specifications that support interoperable descriptions of
    orbital and non-orbital space-based assets, objects, and observations as well
    as terrestrial observations. The ER suggests a framework consolidating these specifications
    as a foundation for modeling, representation, and serialization from space-based
    assets operating at any location in our solar system (3D+ data). This framework
    enables the streaming of 3D+ data to visualization devices (displays, AR, VR)
    for presentation.\r\n\r\n"
