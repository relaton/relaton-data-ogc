abstract:
- content: This document is a deliverable of the OGC Web Services (OWS) Initiative
    - Phase 9 (OWS-9). The report summarizes the work carried out regarding performance
    and endurance testing of data provision services, namely Web Feature Service and
    Event Service. More specifically, the report deals with the performance and endurance
    testing of data provision services commonly used within OWS Aviation testbeds.
    Test runs have been evaluated on the basis of well-defined, service-specific test
    models and the results are documented in detail. Furthermore, a description of
    the service test environment is documented in alignment with the overall OWS-9
    service architecture
