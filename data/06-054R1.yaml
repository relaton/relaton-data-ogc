abstract:
- content: This document specifies the interface to an Image Geopositioning Service
    that adjusts the georeferencing coordinate transformations of multiple images.
    This adjustment is normally done using a photogrammetric triangulation process,
    although other methods could be used. Such triangulation adjusts the parameter
    values of the image georeferencing coordinate transformations using a least-squares
    fitting process to measured image positions with known error statistics.
