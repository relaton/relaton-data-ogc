abstract:
- content: "Disasters are geographic events and therefore, geospatial information,
    tools and applications have the potential to support the management of, and response
    to, disaster scenarios.\r\n\r\nHowever, the use of geospatial data varies significantly
    across disaster and emergency communities. This can often make it difficult to
    share information between different organizations, and sometimes even within the
    same organization, involved in disaster response. This could mean that not everyone
    involved will have the same situational awareness information.\r\n\r\nThere are
    many reasons for why geospatial information is fully used and exploited, included
    a lack of awareness of what geospatial options are available, lack of geospatial
    technology and skills, lack of funding, etc. The Disaster Pilot User Guide aims
    to address some of these issues by providing a non-technical showcase of the workflows
    and tools developed by the Pilot participants demonstrating what opportunities
    there are for disaster and emergency management communities to use geospatial
    solutions in practice.\r\n\r\nFor over 20 years, the Open Geospatial Consortium
    (OGC) has been working on the challenges of information sharing for emergency
    and disaster planning, management, and response. In Disaster Pilot 23 (DP23) the
    aims were to:\r\n\r\nDevelop flexible, scalable, timely and resilient information
    data workflows to support critical disaster management decisions, enabling stakeholder
    collaboration, and\r\nProvide applications and visualization tools to promote
    the wider understanding of how geospatial data can support emergency and disaster
    communities.\r\nAs part of DP23, a trilogy of Guides were developed to improve
    knowledge and understanding of how geospatial data and tools and could support
    disaster and emergency communities. Alongside the User Guide is a Provider Guide
    giving all the detail technical details behind the work, and a companion Operational
    Capacity Guide describing the steps needed to develop geospatial readiness.\r\n\r\nThe
    User Guide contains a summary of the work undertaken in DP23, and Disaster Pilot
    21 (DP21), where participants have worked on disaster scenarios relating to:\r\n\r\nDroughts\r\nWildland
    Fires\r\nFlooding\r\nLandslides\r\nHealth & Earth Observation Data for Pandemic
    Response\r\nCase Studies have focused on the hazards of drought in Manitoba, Canada;
    wildland fires in western United States; flooding in the Red River basin, Canada;
    landslides and flooding in Peru; and Pandemic response in Louisiana, United States.
    The participants have developed various data flows, alongside tools to support
    the collection, discovery, or visualization of data to support disaster management
    and response.\r\n\r\nAnnex A describes the tools and applications developed within
    the Pilots alongside the benefits these can offers. The Guide finishes with details
    of future possibilities, and where the Disaster Pilot initiative could focus next.
    Annexes B to E give descriptions of the data flows developed, including the aspects
    of disaster management or response the data flow relates to; together with the
    benefits it offers and the type of decisions it can support.\r\n\r\nThis document
    is for first responders, emergency managers, decision-makers, and anyone interested
    in encouraging disaster and emergency communities to realize the value of geospatial
    data to save lives and limit damage."
