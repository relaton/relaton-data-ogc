abstract:
- content: "The objective of the Mass Migration Source Integration effort in OGC Testbed
    13 was to understand and document how interoperability tools and practices, including
    open geospatial and security standards, can enable information exchange on an
    international level for humanitarian relief and analysis of mass movement of populations.\r\n\r\nThis
    Engineering Report describes how Testbed 13 participants tested and demonstrated
    situational awareness using Internet and web technologies in a shared information
    exchange platform. The purpose of this platform was to help realize a Common Operational
    Picture (COP) for coordinating humanitarian relief activities among nations and
    organizations. In addition, the platform exercised security-enabled interoperable
    exchange of messages.\r\n\r\n"
