abstract:
- content: "The Asynchronous Messaging for Aviation Engineering Report (ER) focuses
    on the design of an architecture to create an Publish/Subscribe (PubSub) messaging
    layer between different Aviation components such as clients, data provider instances
    and Data Brokers. In order to achieve interoperability among these components,
    the OGC PubSub 1.0 standard forms the basis of this architecture. The design of
    this architecture will cover methods for subscribing for specific subsets of data
    (e.g. Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM) Flights intersecting a given Airspace),
    managing such subscriptions as well as publishing data to the Asynchronous Messaging
    Server. Different delivery methods such as Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
    1.0, Java Message Service (JMS) and OASIS WS-Notification are considered. In particular,
    their harmonization with OGC PubSub 1.0 is evaluated.\r\n\r\nThis report focuses
    on the interface design required to define an interoperable approach for Aviation
    using this OGC PubSub 1.0. Specific service level integrations (i.e., Federal
    Aviation Administration (FAA) System-Wide Information Management (SWIM) and Single
    European Sky ATM Research Programme (SESAR) SWIM) have been investigated but an
    implementation has not been fulfilled."
