abstract:
- content: "OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable
    Web APIs in a consistent way. The OpenAPI specification is used to define the
    API building blocks.\r\n\r\nOGC API Features provides API building blocks to create,
    modify and query features on the Web. OGC API Features is comprised of multiple
    parts, each of them is a separate standard.\r\n\r\nThis part extends the core
    capabilities specified in Part 1: Core with the ability to use coordinate reference
    system identifiers other than the defaults defined in the core."
