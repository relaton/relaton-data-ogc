abstract:
- content: This part of the Web Map Service (WMS) specification applies to those clients
    and servers which allow operation request encodings that are more complex than
    those permitted by the basic keyword/value encoding defined in WMS Part 1 [17].
    Part 2 only describes the encoding of the request messages using Extensible Markup
    Language (XML); all other aspects of the Web Map Service are fully defined in
    Part 1.
