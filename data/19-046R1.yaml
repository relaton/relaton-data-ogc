abstract:
- content: This OGC Testbed-15 Engineering Report (ER) describes the Map Markup Language
    (MapML) enabled client component implementation for the Quebec Lake-River Differentiation
    Model in the Machine Learning (ML) task of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Testbed-15
    (T-15). This ER presents the MapML parsing capabilities that were developed to
    illustrate the outputs of a ML model to delineate lake and river features from
    an undifferentiated waterbody vector dataset in Qu√©bec, Canada. Client data was
    accessed through an OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) interface in coordination
    with an OGC API - Features implementation.
