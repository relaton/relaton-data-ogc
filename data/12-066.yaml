abstract:
- content: This paper presents key aspects of the development of a Dutch 3D standard
    IMGeo as a CityGML ADE. The new ADE is modeled using UML class diagrams. However
    the OGC CityGML specification does not provide clear rules on modeling an ADE
    in UML. This paper describes how the extension was built, which provides general
    insight how CityGML can be extended for a specific applications starting from
    the UML diagrams. Several alternatives for modeling ADEs in UML have been investigated
    and compared. The best suited for the 3D standard option is selected and applied.
    Open issues and challenges are discussed in the conclusions.
