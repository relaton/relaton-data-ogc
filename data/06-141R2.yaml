abstract:
- content: 'This best practices document describes a profile to order Earth Observation
    data products. This document expands on the work presented in Best Practices for
    Earth Observation Products OGC-05-057r4, separating the order services from the
    catalogue services which are now presented in 06-079. The final goal being to
    agree to a coherent set of interfaces for ordering of EO products to support access
    to data from heterogeneous systems dealing with derived data products from satellite
    based measurements of the earth''s surface and environment. '
