abstract:
- content: "Advances in computing, storage, sensing, and other technology areas continue
    to find a place in the geospatial ecosystem that makes location information findable,
    accessible, interoperable, and reusable. To enable geospatial standards to meet
    the likely interoperability needs of future technologies, it is necessary for
    Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) such as OGC to continue to innovate.
    Such innovation relies on the ability to develop new standards and improve existing
    ones to better address emerging interoperability challenges. Code sprints are
    one of a number of initiative types that OGC conducts to accelerate such innovation.
    A code sprint is a collaborative and inclusive event driven by innovative and
    rapid programming with minimal process and organization constraints to support
    the development of new applications and candidate standards.\r\n\r\nThe focus
    of this Engineering Report (ER) is a code sprint that was held from October 30th
    to November 1st, 2023. The code sprint was organized by the Open Geospatial Consortium
    (OGC) and hosted by Geovation in London, England. The code sprint was sponsored
    by Ordnance Survey (OS) at the Gold-level, as well as the European Union Satellite
    Centre (SatCen), US National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), and the UK
    Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) at the Silver-level. As with
    previous OGC Code Sprints, a key goal of the October 2023 Open Standards Code
    Sprint was the acceleration of the development of OGC Standards and their implementation
    in software products.\r\n\r\nStandards in focus for this code sprint included
    several OGC API, data model, and encoding standards. In addition to OGC Standards,
    the code sprint also included a thread focusing on the “GEOINT Imagery Media for
    ISR” (GIMI) profile of the ISO Base Media File Format (ISOBMFF) and the High Efficiency
    Image Format (HEIF). The engineering report concludes that the code sprint met
    all of its objectives and achieved its goal of accelerating the development of
    OGC Standards and their implementation in software products.\r\n\r\nIn relation
    to emerging extensions to OGC API Standards, the engineering report concludes
    that the Publish/Subscribe (PubSub), Security, and Schemas capabilities examined
    in this code sprint could potentially support other OGC API Standards. Regarding
    GIMI, the engineering report concludes that with minor changes to popular open-source
    base libraries a wide range of software can quickly make use of GIMI capabilities.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the Model for Underground Data Definition and Integration (MUDDI), the engineering
    report concludes that the MUDDI Conceptual Model is implementable and could easily
    be used as the basis for a logical model that can be encoded in a variety of formats
    including GML, GeoJSON, and Geopackage. As for JSON-FG, the engineering report
    concludes that due to the evident increase in adoption across the developer community,
    there is an increasing need to offer validators so that developers can check for
    compliance more easily.\r\n\r\nThe sprint participants made the following recommendations
    for future work items on OGC API Standards.\r\n\r\nExtension of OGC API — Records
    to support faceting and federated search.\r\nUse case experimentation to examine
    how the Publish/Subscribe approach can support various OGC API standards workflows.\r\nPrototyping
    and specification on an OpenAPI definition document for the OGC SensorThings API
    Standard.\r\nAdditional support for multiband raster data in OGC API — Maps/Tiles/Coverages
    (e.g., multispectral imagery, etc).\r\nThe sprint participants made the following
    recommendations for future work items on OGC Encoding Standards.\r\n\r\nTiled
    complex, signed, and floating-point data in multiband raster data.\r\nPerformance
    benchmarking between various imagery formats, for a variety of use cases.\r\nExtraction
    of the conceptual model of GMLJP2 to make it applicable to any ISOBMFF profile.\r\nDevelopment
    of an Implementation Standard for the logical model and encoding of data that
    conforms to the MUDDI.\r\nUse of the MUDDI logical schema as a template for MUDDI
    compliance.\r\nThe sprint participants made the following recommendations for
    future work items on GIMI.\r\n\r\nExtension of open-source base libraries used
    by several other products for creation and modification of GIMI files.\r\nPrototype
    streaming of large images from client applications to servers for storage through
    OGC API — Processes.\r\nPrototyping of a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encoded
    alternative to Key-Length-Value (KLV) metadata for use in GIMI files."
