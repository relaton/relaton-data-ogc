abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed-15 Engineering Report (ER) presents a thorough analysis
    of the work produced by the Earth Observation Clouds (EOC) threads in OGC Testbeds
    13 and 14 in relation to the Scale environment. Scale provides management of automated
    processing on a cluster of machines and the SEED specification to aid in the discovery
    and consumption of a discrete unit of work contained within a Docker image. Scale
    and SEED were both developed for the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA)
    of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe ER attempts to explain how the OGC Testbed-13
    and OGC Testbed-14 research results of bringing applications/users to the data
    relate to Scale and SEED.\r\n\r\nChiefly, while comparing the two approaches,
    the report identifies and describes:\r\n\r\nOpportunities for harmonization or
    standardization;\r\n\r\nFeatures which must remain separate and the rationale
    for this;\r\n\r\nThe hard problems which will require additional work; and\r\n\r\nOpportunities
    which should be examined in future initiatives.\r\n\r\nFor developers, the ER
    constitutes a technical reference supporting the comparison of the two approaches,
    thereby enabling developers to make informed choices, understand trade-offs, identify
    relevant standards and clarify misunderstandings."
