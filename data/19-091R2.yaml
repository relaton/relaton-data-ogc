abstract:
- content: Demand for digital representations of built environments is accelerating
    and can only be satisfied through greater software interoperability and data integration.
    The objective of the Integrated Digital Built Environment (IDBE) joint working
    group is to address this challenge by bringing together experts from the Open
    Geospatial Consortium and buildingSMART to coordinate the development of the relevant
    data standards. This document is an output from IDBE in which we describe the
    state of three of the most prominent built environment standards – CityGML, IFC
    and LandInfra – and describe some of the problems that hinder their integration;
    finally, we propose actions points for overcoming these problems.
