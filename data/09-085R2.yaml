- content: 'This document summarizes the types of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs)
    that are recommended for use with grid (including image) coverages.  This document
    specializes Best Practice Paper OGC 09-076r3 “Uses and Summary of Topic 2: Spatial
    referencing by coordinates” for grid coverages.  Topic 2 is almost the same as
    ISO 19111:2007, but includes some corrections.  This document includes some best
    practices for defining and using ImageCRSs and other CRSs for grid coverages.'
