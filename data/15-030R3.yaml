abstract:
- content: "The goal of the Geo4NIEM  thread in OGC Testbed 11 was to gain Intelligence
    Community (IC) concurrence of the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) Version
    3.0 architecture through the development, implementations, test, and robust demonstration
    making use of IC specifications, Geography Markup Language (GML), and NIEM in
    a simulated “real-world” scenario. The demonstration scenario begins with NIEM-conformant
    Information Exchange Packages (IEPs) containing operational data and IC security
    tags from the Information Security Marking (ISM) and Need-To-Know (NTK) access
    control metadata, and the Trusted Data Format (TDF) for binding assertion metadata
    with data resource(s). Those instance documents are deployed using Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) enabled Web Services for access by client applications. Access
    control is based on attributes of the end-user and the instance data\r\nRecommendations
    to update these information exchanges were provided to reflect NIEM 3.0 architecture
    and security tags in a ‘NIEM/IC Data Encoding’. The assessment exercised this
    data encoding in OGC Web Feature Services (WFS) and Policy Enforcement Points
    (PEP) accessed by multiple client applications. The round-trip assessment also
    exercised the OGC Transactional Web Feature Services (WFS-T). Results from this
    task provided a preliminary architecture that was tested and demonstrated in Testbed
    11, and summarized in other OGC Testbed 11 Engineering Reports.\r\n"
