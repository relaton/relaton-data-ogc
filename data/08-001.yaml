abstract:
- content: "This Discussion Paper documents results from the Interoperability Program
    CGDI Pilot and describes a suite of services that enable the sharing of geographic
    information across organizations for the purposes of: geographic database synchronization
    in support of a spatial data infrastructure; geographic database modification
    suggestions from trusted and un-trusted sources; and the transmission of geographic
    information in emergency notification events.\r\n\r\nThese services are called
    the Update Feed Service; Feedback Feed Service; and Emergency Alert Service respectively.
    Their information encodings are all based on the Atom Syndication Format, extended
    with GML and WFS Filter encodings to support geospatial requirements, and were
    implemented in the Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure Pilot.\r\n"
