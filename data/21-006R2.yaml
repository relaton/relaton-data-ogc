abstract:
- content: "This Standard documents the OGC GML Implementation Specification (IS)
    for the CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model. The CityGML 3.0 conceptual model is a Platform
    Independent Model (PIM). It defines concepts in a manner which is independent
    of any implementing technology. As such, the CityGML Conceptual Model cannot be
    implemented directly. Rather, it serves as the base for Platform Specific Models
    (PSM). A PSM adds to the PIM the technology-specific details needed to fully define
    the CityGML model for use with a specific technology. The PSM can then be used
    to generate the schema and other artifacts needed to build CityGML 3.0 implementations.\r\n\r\nThis
    standard defines the PSMs and schemas for the CityGML 3.0 Implementation Specification
    (IS) for Geography Markup Language (GML) implemenations. The GML schemas are explained
    in an overview and design decisions that have been made are documented as well.\r\n\r\n"
