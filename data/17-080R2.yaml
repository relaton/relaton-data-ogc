abstract:
- content: 'The “Multi-Spectral Imagery” extension defines how to encode and store
    reflected electromagnetic radiation from the infrared wavelengths into a CDB.  The
    portion of the spectrum targeted is between the visible spectrum (current imagery
    and texture in CDB), and longer wavelength infrared that is primarily emissive
    and can be simulated based on the material temperature. '
