abstract:
- content: "This best practice document on UML to JSON encoding rules is an initiative
    of Geonovum. The aim is to come to a standardized encoding from UML to JSON, in
    order to achieve technical interoperability in the chain from conceptual models
    to JSON implementation. In this document, JSON implementation includes plain JSON,
    GeoJSON and JSON-FG.\r\n\r\nApplication schemas in UML are used to model geospatial
    information for a given domain, as part of data specifications defining information
    and data content of a relevant universe of discourse. In the geospatial domain,
    UML profiles are defined by ISO 19103:2015 and ISO 19109:2015. These profiles
    are also used in this document. Application schemas operate at the conceptual
    level. At the implementation or data level, JSON is one of the major data encodings
    used by current web applications. The UML to JSON encoding rules defined in the
    context of this document is a best practice. Eventually, this document may also
    support the development of an international standard for the conversion of UML
    to JSON (Schema) in the geospatial domain.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate a proper JSON
    encoding, an extension of the ISO 19103 and 19109 UML profiles is proposed, resulting
    in a UML-JSON encoding profile.\r\n\r\nThe encoding rules are structured in 40
    requirements and a number of recommendations, subdivided into 18 core requirements,
    1 requirement specific for plain JSON schema format, 5 for GeoJSON format, 5 for
    JSON-FG Schema format, 3 requirements for binding and referencing of elements,
    2 for union constructs, 5 for code lists and 1 for encoding a dedicated entity
    property in JSON. The requirement classes are supported by UML examples and subsequent
    JSON encodings.\r\n\r\n"
