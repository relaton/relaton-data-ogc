abstract:
- content: "CityGML is an open conceptual data model for the storage and exchange
    of virtual 3D city models. It is defined through a Unified Modeling Language (UML)
    object model. This UML model extends the ISO Technical Committee 211 (TC211) conceptual
    model standards for spatial and temporal data. Building on the ISO foundation
    assures that the man-made features described in the City Models share the same
    spatial-temporal universe as the surrounding countryside within which they reside.
    The aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition of the basic
    entities, attributes, and relations of a 3D city model. This is especially important
    with respect to the cost-effective sustainable maintenance of 3D city models,
    allowing the reuse of the same data in different application fields.\r\n\r\nThis
    Users Guide provides extended explanations and examples for the individual concepts
    that are defined in the CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model Standard. Both documents,
    the Conceptual Model Standard and the Users Guide, are mutually linked to facilitate
    navigation between corresponding sections in these documents."
