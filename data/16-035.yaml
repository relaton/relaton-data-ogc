abstract:
- content: REST interfaces facilitate the application of OGC standards in many novel
    application scenarios, e.g. implementing OGC clients on constrained devices, as
    they ease the implementation of service requests and simplify the interaction
    patterns. Thereby, REST serves as a complementary technology to the already existing
    SOAP/POX provided by most of the current OGC standards. This engineering report
    (ER) provides an overview on different REST service implementations in the Testbed-12
    and in related activities. As a result, this ER can be used to develop recommendations
    on architecture guidelines for providing REST interfaces in the geospatial domain.
