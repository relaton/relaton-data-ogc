abstract:
- content: "This document describes the Web Services Façade which was developed by
    LISAsoft as part of the OWS-9 testbed. The document also includes discussions
    about lessons learned during the development, and suggestions for future development.\r\nThis
    Engineering Report documents the Web Services Façade work done within OWS-9 as
    an extensible, open source tool, which supports translations between different
    protocols for a specific web service. For the OWS-9 testbed, it has been set up
    to translate between POST and SOAP services for a Web Feature Service. However,
    it can be configured to support translations between multiple protocols, such
    as REST, SOAP, KVP, JSON, as well as supporting multiple web services.\r\nThe
