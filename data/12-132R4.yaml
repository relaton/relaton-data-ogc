abstract:
- content: This OGCÂ® Standard defines the Augmented Reality Markup Language 2.0 (ARML
    2.0). ARML 2.0 allows users to describe virtual objects in an Augmented Reality
    (AR) scene with their appearances and their anchors (a broader concept of a location)
    related to the real world. Additionally, ARML 2.0 defines ECMAScript bindings
    to dynamically modify the AR scene based on user behavior and user input.
