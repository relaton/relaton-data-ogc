abstract:
- content: "This Best Practice document describes a lightweight SOS 2.0 profile for
    stationary in-situ\r\nsensors. Besides the SOS itself this document also addresses
    the data formats used by the\r\nSOS: Observations & Measurements 2.0 (O&M) for
    encoding measurement data and the\r\nSensor Model Language 2.0 (SensorML) for
    encoding metadata. Other SWE standards\r\nwhich provide more specialized functionality
    are not part of this minimum lightweight\r\nSWE profile.\r\nThe aim of this document
    is to present a common minimum profile of the SOS. The\r\nprofile is intended
    to reduce the complexity of the standard by omitting highly specific\r\nelements
    that are not necessary for the majority of use cases that occur in practice. At
    the\r\nsame time, the profile is designed in such a way that all SOS implementations
    that\r\nconform to this profile are also compliant to the according OGC specifications."
