abstract:
- content: The OGC Testbed-16 Machine Learning (ML) Training Data Engineering Report
    (ER) describes training data used for developing a Wildfire Response application.
    Within the context of the application, this ER discusses the challenges and makes
    a set of recommendations. The two scenarios for the wildfire use case include
    fuel load estimation and water body identification. The ML training data described
    in this ER are based on these two scenarios. Suggestions are also made for future
    work on a model for ML training dataset metadata, which is intended to provide
    vital information on the data and therefore facilitate the uptake of training
    data by the ML community. Additionally, this ER summarizes the discussions and
    issues about ML training data among the Testbed-16 ML thread participants and
    draws conclusions and recommendations for future work on the subject. Finally,
    this ER also links to current Analysis Ready Data (ARD) principles and efforts,
    in particular in the Earth Observation (EO) community.
