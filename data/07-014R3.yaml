abstract:
- content: 'The OpenGISÂ® Sensor Planning Service Interface Standard (SPS) defines
    interfaces for queries that provide information about the capabilities of a sensor
    and how to task the sensor. The standard is designed to support queries that have
    the following purposes: to determine the feasibility of a sensor planning request;
    to submit such a request; to inquire about the status of such a request; to update
    or cancel such a request; and to request information about other OGC Web services
    that provide access to the data collected by the requested task. This is one of
    the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) [http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/markets-technologies/swe]
    suite of standards.'
