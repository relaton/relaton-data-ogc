abstract:
- content: "The OGC provides a collaborative, consensus process for developing and
    approving open, international Standards and supporting content for the geospatial
    domain, collectively known as OGC Products. To guide the OGC Product development
    and approval process, a member-approved Policies and Procedures document for the
    Technical Committee (TC) is required.\r\n\r\nThis document describes the TC Policies
    and Procedures (TC PnP). The TC has been granted authority to operate by the OGC
    Bylaws. The TC is composed of individuals representing organizations that are
    duly recognized members in good standing of the OGC.\r\n\r\nAs the needs and purpose
    of the TC change, changes to these policies and procedures are approved by an
    electronic vote of the Voting Members of the OGC TC. These policies and procedures
    may be augmented or clarified by Policy Directives issued and approved by the
    TC or the Executive Planning Committee (EPC). Such directives are databased and
    hyperlinked to/from the appropriate portion of this document."
