abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report (ER) enhances the understanding of the relationships
    between data exchange based on Geography Markup Language (GML), JavaScript Object
    Notation (JSON), and Resource Description Framework (RDF) for future web services,
    e.g. Web Feature Service (WFS) 3.0. The work documented in this report:\r\n\r\ncontributes
    to the ability to bridge between technology-dependent alternate representations
    of “features” (real-world objects), and to consistently employ alternate encoding
    technologies (Extensible Markup Language (XML), JSON, RDF) to exchange information
    about “features”; and\r\n\r\ndetermines principled techniques for the development
    of JSON-based schemas from ISO 19109-conformant application schemas.\r\n\r\n"
