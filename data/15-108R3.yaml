abstract:
- content: The purpose of the GetCorridor operation is to extract a corridor based
    on a trajectory from a multidimensional coverage. The need for the getCorridor
    operation stems from active members of the OGC MetOcean Domain Working Group (DWG)
    who saw a manifest need for extraction of such information from gridded datasets.
    This work has been done by members of the OGC MetOcean Domain Working Group.
