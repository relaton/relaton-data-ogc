abstract:
- content: WaterML 2.0 is a standard information model for the representation of water
    observations data, with the intent of allowing the exchange of such data sets
    across information systems. Through the use of existing OGC standards, it aims
    at being an interoperable exchange format that may be re-used to address a range
    of exchange requirements, some of which are described later in this document.
