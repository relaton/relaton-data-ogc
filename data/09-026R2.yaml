abstract:
- content: "A fundamental operation performed on a set of data or resources is that
    of querying in order to obtain a subset of the data which contains certain desired
    information that satisfies some query criteria and which is also, perhaps, sorted
    in some specified manner.\r\n\r\nThis International Standard defines an abstract
    component, named AbstractQueryExpression, from which other specifications can
    subclass concrete query elements to implement query operations. This International
    Standard also defines an additional abstract query component, named AbstractAdhocQueryExpresison,
    which is derived from AbstractQueryExpression and from which other specifications
    can subclass concrete query elements which follow a query pattern composed of
    a list of resource types to query, a projection clause specifying the properties
    of those resources to present in the result, a projection clause composed of predicates
    that define the subset of resources or data in the result set and a sorting clause
    indicating to order in which the results should be presented. This pattern is
    referred to as an ad hoc query pattern since the server is not aware of the query
    until it is submitted for processing. This is in contrast to a stored query expression,
    which is stored and can be invoked by name or identifier.\r\n\r\nThis International
    Standard describes an XML and KVP encoding of a system-neutral syntax for expressing
    the projection, selection and sorting clauses of a query expression. The intent
    is that this neutral representation can be easly validated, parsed and then translated
    into some target query language such as SPARQL or SQL for processing."
