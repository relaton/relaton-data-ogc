abstract:
- content: "The National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) Application Schema
    (NAS) is an ISO 19109 compliant application schema that defines the conceptual
    model for identifying and encoding feature data in the U.S. National System for
    Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG). NGA utilizes the open source software tool ShapeChange
    as an integral piece in NAS development. This tool is used to take NAS-based UML
    models and create Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Resource Description Framework
    (RDF) based schemas. Testbed-12 began development of capabilities for extracting
    profiles supporting specific mission functions from the full NAS content. Testbed-13
    further refined the approach to NAS Profiling by investigating how a specific
    profile (Urban Military Profile) can be processed in an automated way and used
    to derive implementation schemas for the OGC standards CDB and CityGML.\r\n\r\nThis
    OGC Engineering Report describes:\r\n\r\nThe specification of a NAS-based Military
    Urban Profile as a Unified Modeling Language (UML) model (chapter 5);\r\n\r\nHow
    mission-specific sub-profiles can be specified and maintained using ShapeChange
    and the new ShapeChange Profile Management Tool (chapter 6); and\r\n\r\nHow the
    model and profile information are processed to derive output for\r\n\r\na CDB
    data store (chapter 7, chapter 8) and\r\n\r\na CityGML Application Domain Extension
    (chapter 9).\r\n\r\nThis work provides insights into:\r\n\r\nThe requirements
    and constraints on managing profiles of complex ISO 19109 compliant application
    schemas such as the NAS; and\r\n\r\nUsing a model-driven approach to generate
    implementation schemas of an ISO 19109 compliant application schema profile for
    different environments.\r\n\r\nThe target audience of this document is anyone
    interested in these topics. The implementation environments discussed in this
    report are the OGC standards CDB and CityGML. The profiled application schema
    is the NAS.\r\n\r\nThis report assumes that readers are familiar with the key
    concepts and technologies discussed in this document. This document does not provide
    an introduction to them, but the table below provides a brief summary and pointers
    to more information."
