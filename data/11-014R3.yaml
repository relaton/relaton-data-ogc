abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the Open Modelling Interface (OpenMI) is to enable the
    runtime exchange of data between process simulation models and also between models
    and other modelling tools such as databases and analytical and visualization applications.
    Its creation has been driven by the need to understand how processes interact
    and to predict the likely outcomes of those interactions under given conditions.
    A key design aim has been to bring about interoperability between independently
    developed modelling components, where those components may originate from any
    discipline or supplier. The ultimate aim is to transform integrated modelling
    into an operational tool accessible to all and so open up the potential opportunities
    created by integrated modelling for innovation and wealth creation. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis
    document defines the requirements that a component must meet to achieve OpenMI
    compliance. These comprise: 1) a very thin core set of requirements covering the
    information and functions needed to establish a link and make an exchange between
    two components and 2) a set of optional extensions for handling more complex situations.
    The document does not describe how to implement the standard. This information
    together with a range of software tools for creating and running OpenMI-­&#8208;compliant
    components are provided by the OpenMI Association and third-­&#8208;party software
    vendors – visit www.openmi.org for further documentation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=59022>pdf</a>
