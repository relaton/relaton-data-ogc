abstract:
- content: "The geospatial community has had an on-going challenge with being able
    to share data and compute resources in dynamic, collaborative environments that
    span different administrative domains. For these types of requirements, the concept
    of federation has been developed. The near-term goal of the Federated Cloud task
    in OGC Testbed-14 is to demonstrate a specific data-sharing scenario among two
    or more administrative domains using existing security tooling, e.g., OpenID Connect
    and OAuth. The main details of this work are reported as part of the OGC Testbed-14
    Security Engineering Report (ER) cite:[SecurityER]. This Federated Cloud Engineering
    Report (ER) dovetails with the Security ER to:\r\n\r\nCoordinate across all federation-related
    tasks in Testbed-14, including the Earth Observation Cloud and Workflow tasks,\r\n\r\nUnderstand
    the overall federation design space,\r\n\r\nAnalyze and critique the scope, trade-offs
    and limitations of the federation capabilities being built and demonstrated in
    Testbed-14,\r\n\r\nIdentify and prioritize possible incremental development tasks
    for subsequent testbeds, and\r\n\r\nLiaison with groups external to OGC, such
    as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/Institute of Electrical
    and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Joint Working Group on Federated Cloud, to promote
    the further development and adoption of federated capabilities, and ultimately
    international standards.\r\n\r\n"
