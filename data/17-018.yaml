abstract:
- content: OGC 17-018 (Testbed-13 Data Quality Specification Engineering Report) provides
    methods to quantify the quality concepts defined in OGC 17-032 and a way to include
    the quantifications in service descriptions. It extends QualityML quality metrics
    (that already includes ISO 19157) into the aviation domain. It lists a set of
    quantitative and conformance measurements that are specified in terms of quality
    measures, domains, and metrics (value types and units) and are appropriated for
    each quality type and data type. Secondly, it extends the SDCM to be able to encode
    and include the above mentioned quality information for each service in a interoperable
    way.
