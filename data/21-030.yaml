abstract:
- content: This Engineering Report (ER) presents an analysis of the semantic model
    of the Sensor Integration Framework (SIF). After reviewing the current SIF Semantic
    Model, existing related ontologies are reviewed. The ER discusses the results
    and includes all lessons learned from the experiments completed by the Sensor
    Integration thread of the OGC Testbed-17 initiative. The ER presents a series
    of recommendations based on the lessons learned.
