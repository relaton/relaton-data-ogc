abstract:
- content: "With the consolidation of tiling services and the increasing number of
    instances implementing the WMTS standard, there is a need for having a way to
    transfer a collection of tiles from one service to another. This might also be
    useful to transfer all necessary tiles from a WMTS service to a GeoPackage. Currently
    the only available solution is a client that is able to resolve the identifiers
    of the tiles needed and that builds a WMTS independent request for each tile.
    This ER explores different solutions that are more appropriate depending on how
    many tiles we need to move and the final application of them. Some of the proposed
    solutions involve changes in the WMTS standard and the use of a WPS. The WPS standard
    also shows some limitations and extensions that should be addressed.\r\n\r\nIn
    essence all solutions should describe two things: A request that contains a filter
    to a collection of tiles filling regions of the space and a multipart response
    that contains the tiles preferably in a single package. Depending on the proposed
    architecture, these tasks are done directly in the client, in the WMTS server
    or in an intermediate WPS."
