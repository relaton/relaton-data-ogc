abstract:
- content: Sustainable development, meeting the needs of the present without compromising
    the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,  will be accomplished
    by balancing social, economic and environmental objectives.  In this paper the
    authors explain that rigorous standards for communicating environmental data are
    absolutely essential to enable social and economic progress in the Age of the
    Environment  – the Anthropocene Epoch  – in which humanity's expanding footprint
    has become the main cause of change in the planet's geology, water bodies, atmosphere
    and biosphere. The authors argue for a concerted and ongoing global effort to
    1) define data communication and system interoperability requirements for environmental
    science, business and policy, and then 2) develop and implement consensus-derived,
    free and open environmental Information Technology (IT) standards that meet those
    requirements and that co-evolve with the larger IT standards framework and advances
    in IT.
