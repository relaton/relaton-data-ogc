abstract:
- content: "Sustainable development, meeting the needs of the present without compromising
    the\r\nability of future generations to meet their own needs,1\r\n will be accomplished
    by\r\nbalancing social, economic and environmental objectives. In this paper the
    authors\r\nexplain that rigorous standards for communicating environmental data
    are absolutely\r\nessential to enable social and economic progress in the Age
    of the Environment2 – the\r\nAnthropocene Epoch3 – in which humanity's expanding
    footprint has become the main\r\ncause of change in the planet's geology, water
    bodies, atmosphere and biosphere. The\r\nauthors argue for a concerted and ongoing
    global effort to 1) define data communication\r\nand system interoperability requirements
    for environmental science, business and policy,\r\nand then 2) develop and implement
    consensus-derived, free and open environmental\r\nInformation Technology (IT)
    standards that meet those requirements and that co-evolve\r\nwith the larger IT
    standards framework and advances in IT."
