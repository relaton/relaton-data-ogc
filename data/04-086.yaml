abstract:
- content: "*RETIRED* This document describes the role of Discovery Services in the
    net-centric enterprise. The network centric enterprise is an environment with
    an almost infinite variety of resources. In this rich environment, suitable resources
    can be found to support almost any operational need. The problem, however, is
    finding the appropriate resources when they are needed. Discovery services address
    this problem."
