abstract:
- content: "This OGC Best Practice describes how user and identity management information
    may be included in the protocol specifications for OGC Services. The proposed
    approach is applicable to the orchestration of EO services, to system of systems
    and federation scenarios. The approach is meant to be independent from the specific
    OGC service. The use cases potentially addressed are very wide and in general
    may cover geospatial services and not only EO (Earth Observation) services. The
    use cases may range from web map, feature or coverage services, web processing
    services, to catalogue services. Examples of EO specific use cases are: ordering
    (Ordering Services for Earth Observation Products [OGC 06-141r6]) and feasibility
    analysis (OpenGIS Sensor Planning Service Application Profile for EO Sensors [OGC
    10 135]). \r\nThe document was initially produced during the ESA HMA (Heterogeneous
    Missions Accessibility) initiative [OR1] and related projects.\r\nThis document
    is not an OGC standard.  This document describes how existing specifications from
    W3C and OASIS can be used in combination to pass identity information to OGC Web
    services.\r\n"
