abstract:
- content: "This standard defines an information model and XML encoding for exchanging
    the\r\nfollowing three hydrological information resources:\r\n1. Conversion tables,
    or conversion curves, that are used for the conversion of\r\nrelated hydrological
    phenomenon.\r\n2. Gauging observations â€“ the observations performed to develop
    conversion table\r\nrelationships.\r\n3. Cross sections - survey observations
    made of the geometric structure of features,\r\nsuch as river channels, storages
    etc.\r\nMetadata and vocabularies are defined that together provide a means for
    parties to\r\nexchange these concepts using common semantics.\r\nThis standard
    is the second part of the WaterML2.0 suite of standards, building on part 1\r\nthat
    addresses the exchange of time series.\r\n"
