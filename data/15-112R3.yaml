abstract:
- content: This CDB Volume provides terms and definitions.  Many of the terms and
    definitions are specific to the simulation industry. Other terms and definitions
    have been updated to be consistent with the ISO 19xxx (Geomatics) series of standards,
    specifically ISO 19111 Spatial referencing by Coordinates and ISO 19017 Spatial
    Schema. Some work still remains to make the terms and definitions completely consistent
    with current OGC and ISO best practice.
