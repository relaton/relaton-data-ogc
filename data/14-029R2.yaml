abstract:
- content: "This document provides a technical description of the Virtual Global Gazetteer
    implemented for OGC Testbed 10.  \r\nThe Virtual Global Gazetteer integrates two
    gazetteers – a copy of the USGS gazetteer containing domestic names and a copy
    of the NGA gazetteer containing non-domestic names (hosted by Interactive Instruments)
    and provides the capability to link to additional local gazetteers and linked
    data information, allowing a user to retrieve extended information on locations
    selected from either of the initial gazetteers. The access to linked data information
    provided by these gazetteers was achieved by GeoSPARQL enabling these gazetteers
    using semantic mapping components\r\n"
