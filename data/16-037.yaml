abstract:
- content: This OGC Engineering Report documents the outcome of the US Topo experiment.
    The focus of the US Topo experiment was to generate GeoPackages by combining USGS
    Topo Map Vector Data Products [1]; and the Topo TNM Style Template [2]. The output
    GeoPackages will contain both features and instructions for styling these features
    as well as orthoimagery, shaded relief raster tilesets, national wetlands raster
    tilesets and elevation data derived from USGS provide 1/9 arc second elevation
    imagery. The process used to generate the GeoPackage is explained. Problems and
    obstacles encountered decoding the source product and styles and converting these
    artifacts to a GeoPackage are explained with recommendations for improvements.
    Additionally, the experience applying the generated GeoPackage in two use cases
    proposed for this testbed will be evaluated. The introduction of symbolization
    for vector features will be articulated as a proposed extension for GeoPackage.
    Any issues related to encoding the TNM style template using the extension are
    documented.
