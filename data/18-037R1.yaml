abstract:
- content: "This OGC discussion paper presents an approach to harmonize the OGC GeoPackage
    and OWS Context standards through a set of extensions. GeoPackage is an open,
    standards-based, platform-independent, portable, self-describing, compact format
    for storing and transferring geospatial data and information as part of an SQLite
    database. OWS Context is an open format linking geospatial web services and information.
    A draft standard has been produced and this Discussion Paper is designed to be
    a companion to that draft standard to assist in discussion. The draft standard
    contains extensions to both GeoPackage and OWS Context.\r\n\r\nThis document is
    the work of collaboration between the GeoPackage and OWS Context Standards Working
    Groups (SWGs)."
