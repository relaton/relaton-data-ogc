abstract:
- content: This document defines a profile of the Geography Markup Language (GML)
    version 3.1.1 for encoding definitions of grid coverage (including image) Coordinate
    Reference Systems (CRSs) plus related coordinate Transformations. This document
    also specifies some Universal Resource Names (URNs) for definitions in the ogc
    URN namespace, in addition to those specified in [OGC 05-010]. Additional specific
    URNs are defined for definitions of the datums, coordinate systems, and coordinate
    system axes which are often used in definitions of grid and image CRSs.
