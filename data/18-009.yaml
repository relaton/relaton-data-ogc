abstract:
- content: "The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the Department of Science & Technology
    (DST) under the Government of India conducted the OGC India Plugfest 2017 (OIP-2017).
    The OIP-2017 was targeted at enhancing the interoperability among geospatial products
    and web services based on OGC standards within the Indian Geospatial Information
    (GI) community. The successful conclusion of OIP-2017 will assist National Spatial
    Data Infrastructure (NSDI) under DST to provide guidance on best practices using
    OGC standards for development of applications in several important & flagship
    schemes/programmes of the Government such as Smart Cities, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation
    through Urban Trasnformation (AMRUT); National Land Records Moderinisation Programme
    (NLRMP); Clean India (Swatchh Bharat â€“ Urban & Rural); National Mission on Clean
    Ganga; Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management & Planning Authority (CAMPA);
    State SDIs; Digital India, and others.\r\nThis engineering report written jointly
    by OGC and DST is addressed to both the domestic (Indian) and international audiences.\r\nOIP-2017
    was funded by the OGC India Foundation with supporting OGC staff resources from
    the OGC Innovation Program.\r\n"
