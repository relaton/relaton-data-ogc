abstract:
- content: This document specifies conceptual schemas for describing the spatial characteristics
    of geographic entities, and a set of spatial operations consistent with these
    schemas. It treats vector geometry and topology. It defines standard spatial operations
    for use in access, query, management, processing and data exchange of geographic
    information for spatial (geometric and topological) objects. Because of the nature
    of geographic information, these geometric coordinate spaces will normally have
    up to three spatial dimensions, one temporal dimension and any number of other
    spatially dependent parameters as needed by the applications. In general, the
    topological dimension of the spatial projections of the geometric objects will
    be at most three.
