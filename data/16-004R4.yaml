abstract:
- content: "This CDB volume provides all of the information required to store Radar
    Cross Section (RCS) data within a conformant CDB data store.  \r\nPlease note
    that the current CDB standard only provides encoding rules for using Esri ShapeFiles
    for storing RCS models. However, this Best Practice has been modified to change
    most of the ShapeFile references to “vector data sets” or “vector attributes”
    and “Point Shapes” to “Point geometries”. This was done in recognition that future
    versions of the CDB standard and related Best Practices will provide guidance
    on using other encodings/formats, such as OGC GML.\r\n"
