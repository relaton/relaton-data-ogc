abstract:
- content: "This document is applicable to scenarios where moving sensors need to
    be tracked and their entry into an area of interest needs to be detected.\r\n\r\nThe
    document presents a detailed discussion of different approaches for encoding tracked
    object position.\r\n\r\nTwo approaches for implementing dynamic sensor tracking
    and notification are described, one based on the Sensor Alert Service specification
    and the other based on the Sensor Event Service specification.\r\n\r\nAn overview
    of standards and specifications relevant for and related to dynamic sensor tracking
    and notification is provided.\r\n"
