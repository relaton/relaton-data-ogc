abstract:
- content: "This white paper provides an overview of the land administration domain
    and proposes actions needed for design and develop implementation standards this
    domain. A close cooperation between the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and ISO
    is expected to accelerate those developments.\r\n\r\nA huge task is waiting: the
    establishment of land rights for all: young and old, rich and poor, male and female.
    Data on many millions of parcels, spatial units, (use-) rights, persons, and parties
    have to be collected, linked, maintained, and published. Land Administration Systems
    (LAS) should be designed for maintenance of the dynamic relations between people
    and land. Existing land administrations require extensions: such as 3D and 4D
    functionality and datasets, blockchain for transparent transactions, generic processes
    and integration with remote sensing, and processes to support conversion from
    social to legal tenure.\r\n\r\nA broad range of geospatial technologies and applications
    are available. They range from satellite and drone imaging and mapping, to geodesy,
    precise positioning, geo‐information science, cartography, spatial data infrastructure,
    and many surveying sub‐disciplines. The scientific and professional disciplines
    in the geospatial community design, develop, and apply those technologies. Apart
    from this technical component, a land administration also has a social and legal
    component. This makes land administration an arena where, apart from the geospatial
    community, many different scientific and professional disciplines meet. Depending
    on the stage of development and the level of societal acceptance of the land administration,
    those disciplines involved may be different."
