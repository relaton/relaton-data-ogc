abstract:
- content: This document describes the work done during the OWS-8 test bed investigating
    methods and apparatus for distributing individual geospatial data sets and/or
    collections of data sets in a consistent manner between machines that may or may
    not be connected via a network.  The investigation focuses on the initialization
    of a target WFS, from a source WFS, for the purpose of GeoSynchronization.  Data,
    schema, metadata and/or topology are exported from a source WFS, transferred to
    a target WFS (either electronically or physically via some media) and then imported
    into the target WFS.  From that point on, the two WFS's are maintained in synchrony
    using a Geosynchronization Service (see OGC 10-069r2).
