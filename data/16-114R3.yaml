abstract:
- content: 'The netCDF Moving Features encoding extension is a summary of conventions
    that supports efficient exchange of simple moving features as binary files. This
    Best Practice is a complement to the Moving Features Encoding Part I: XML Core
    and an alternative to the Simple Comma Separated Values (CSV) extension. Compared
    to the CSV encoding, this netCDF encoding offers more compact storage and better
    performance at the cost of additional restrictions on the kinds of features that
    can be stored.'
