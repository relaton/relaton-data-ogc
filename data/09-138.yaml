- content: 'This OGC Engineering Report (ER) provides discussions and recommendations
    for information fusion, with a focus on geospatial information. In this ER, fusion
    is discussed in three categories: sensor fusion, object/feature fusion, and decision
    fusion. Recommendations in this ER will be considered in the planning of future
    activities including the OWS-7 Testbed.'
