abstract:
- content: The Web Image Classification Service (WICS) supports classification of
    digital images. A digital image is composed of pixel values organized into one
    or more two-dimensional arrays. The two dimensions of an image represent two axes
    in space based on a spatial coordinate reference system. The dimensions of the
    different 2-D arrays comprising an image must be the same and represent exactly
    the same spatial locations.
