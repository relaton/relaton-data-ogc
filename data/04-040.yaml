abstract:
- content: "This document describes the proposed system design for the OGC Style Management
    Service (SMS). \r\nThe SMS must manage distinct objects that represent styles
    and symbols and provide the means to discover, query, insert, update, and delete
    these objects. \r\nStyles provide the mapping from feature types and feature properties
    and constraints to parameterized Symbols used in drawing maps. Symbols are bundles
    of predefined graphical parameters and predefined fixed graphics.\r\n"
