abstract:
- content: This Engineering Report (ER) describes the OGC Testbed-15 Open Portrayal
    Framework (OPF) Thread requirements, scenario, high-level architecture, and solutions.
    Main topics addressed in the OPF Thread include style changing and sharing, converting
    style encodings, client- / server-side rendering of vector- and raster data and
    data provision in denied, disrupted, intermittent, and limited bandwidth (DDIL)
    infrastructure situations. The work in the OPF Thread was focused on an OGC Application
    Programming Interface (API) oriented approach.
