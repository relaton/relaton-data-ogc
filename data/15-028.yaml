abstract:
- content: This document is a deliverable of the OGC Testbed 11 Interoperability initiative.
    The report’s contents cover the summary of the interoperability work regarding
    the Aviation Data Broker concept. This data broker concept enables the setup of
    cascading OGC Web Feature Server (WFS) servers to form a data source chain, in
    which one service is capable of providing information coming from one or more
    other services. The objectives of this document are to research the feasibility
    of this concept and to investigate a number of specific Data Broker responsibilities
    and use cases, such as provenance and lineage, conflation, caching, scalability
    and flexible management of data sources.
