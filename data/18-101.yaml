abstract:
- content: "The purpose of the OGC Vector Tiles Pilot Extension (VTPExt) was to address
    portrayal and style encoding concerns that were discovered in the initial phase
    of the Vector Tiles Pilot (VTP). During the VTPExt, participants selected a common
    baseline style used by all participants and in some cases created additional style
    offerings. The work conducted during the VTPExt has adhered to the established
    findings from the initial VTP documented in the VTP Summary Engineering Report
    (ER) [1].\r\n\r\nThis document describes the following:\r\n\r\nthe research and
    evaluation to determine approach(es) to apply styling to Mapbox and GeoJSON Tiled
    Feature Data through Web Feature Service (WFS) 3.0, Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)
    1.0, and GeoPackage (GPKG) 1.2,\r\n\r\nthe styling approach, challenges, and interoperability
    considerations discovered during the initiative, and\r\n\r\nany extensions required
    or best practices recommended to facilitate development, encoding, offering, and
    exchange of styles. This includes how styles are offered from servers, how the
    desired style offering can be selected by the client from multiple server style
    offerings (e.g. GetStyles request), and how clients can apply their own styles."
