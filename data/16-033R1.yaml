abstract:
- content: "This engineering report capture the work to extend the existing Web Coverage
    Service (WCS) profiles, particularly the Earth Observation Application Profile
    (EO-WCS [OGC 10-140r1]) to support multi-dimensional subsetting of 3D space and
    1D time. The updated EO-WCS (EO-WCS1.1 [OGC 10-140r2]) have removed the requirement
    for the 2D coverages so that it can explicitly allow coverages with more dimensions
    as long as they have geographic footprint. Furthermore it also clarified the use
    of rangeType when non-NCNAME characters are present in a band identifier. The
    example of GetCapabilites, DescribeEOCoverageSet, and _GetCoverage request in
    the updated EO-WCS1.1 is shown with use case on fire emission data in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nFollowing
    the recommendation for EO-WCS to fully embrace the N-D, multi-dimensional, concept
    of Coverages as a function of time and other coordinates alongside the geospatial
    ones, the proposed recommendations/changes in the extension for WCS DescribeCoverage,
    EO-WCS DescribeEOCoverageSet, and WCS GetCoverage are discussed with use case
    example using National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global 0.25
    deg wind data. Based on the mutual recommendation from the US National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration (NASA) and Baart et. al (2012), Network Common Data Form
    (NetCDF) was the output format due to presence of its libraries in multiple languages
    to lower the burden in changing on developers of WCS-compliant servers and clients.\r\n\r\nFor
    the extension of the WCS DescribeCoverage, it is recommended that CIS1.1 should
    be considered adopting a scheme for transmitting coordinates similar to the _cis:rangeSet
    where data are referred to as an attached Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
    (MIME) part. Time, as much as possible, be treated as just another coordinates
    dimension so that it could be access with the same tools used for other coordinate
    dimensions. To tackle the issue on order of coordinate dimensions, it is recommended
    to add implementation note to the EO-WCS specifications so that implementers are
    aware of the mismatches between dataset coordinate reference systems (CRSs) and
    actual axis order.\r\n\r\nFor the extension of EO_WCS DescribeEOCoverageSet, the
    issue on missing range of results API needed to be resolved by adding a request
    mechanism for requesting a range of matching results. It is also recommended that
    DescribeEOCoverageSet activity might be of more use to the client if the client
    need to supply only the subset conditions, and not a list of identifiers.\r\n\r\nFor
    the extension of WCS GetCoverage, it was discovered that for the GetCoverage operation
    for higher dimensioned datasets, existing WCS-2.0 request interface provided adequate
    syntax for subsetting higher dimensional data. Scaling (re-gridding) operation
    appears to be a natural fit for the EO-WCS subsetting, specifically SCALEEXTENT
    activity, however simpler explanation might be needed to fully understand its
    use as it appears other scaling and subsetting commands may be more than adequate
    for the desired outcomes. Additionally allowing SlicePoint subsetting is also
    recommended.\r\n\r\nAfter performing the testing in the client side, there were
    few potential recommendations for improvements. More information on whether the
    coverage is 2D or 3D form the GetCapalilites request might be helpful to client
    so it can limit the number of DescribeCoverage requests to construct a list of
    available coverage on the server. Furthermore additional metadata information
    for displaying meaningful native gird coordinates is also recommended for clarification.
    Finally automatic detection of lat/lon axes along with clear treatment of XY and
    lat/lon axes ordering would be an improvement in the existing operations."
