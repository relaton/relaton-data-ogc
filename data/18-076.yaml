abstract:
- content: "Feature data tiling, colloquially referred to as 'vector tiling', is a
    method that defines how large vector geospatial datasets can be systematically
    split into subsets or tiles [1]. Feature data tiling allows for a variety of use-cases,
    such as creating online maps, quickly accessing large vector data sets for geoprocessing
    and creating download-services. For instance, a map created from tiled feature
    data consists of one or more layers of vector data organized into tiles of features
    and rendered on the client-side using an associated style. In contrast, raster
    tiles are delivered as tiled images that have been rendered on the server-side.\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\nThis
    engineering report interchangeably uses both 'tiled feature data' and the colloquial
    term 'vector tiles'."
