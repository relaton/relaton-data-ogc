abstract:
- content: "This OGC White Paper discusses cloud computing from the perspective of
    OGCâ€™s\r\ngeospatial standards development activities and standards baseline. The
    paper begins\r\nwith a discussion of what the cloud and cloud computing are. Unfortunately,
    there is still\r\nconsiderable misunderstanding in the geospatial technology community
    regarding cloud\r\ncomputing. The paper then discusses how standards figure into
    the options, benefits and\r\nrisks of cloud computing for users and providers
    of geospatial data and software. This\r\nperspective is important not only for
    those immersed in geospatial technology, but also for\r\ncloud service providers,
    customers and technology partners who may be unfamiliar with\r\nthe basic issues
    surrounding geospatial technology. This white paper does not discuss\r\nvendor
    specific cloud computing platforms."
