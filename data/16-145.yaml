abstract:
- content: 'This Note describes CoverageJSON, a data format for describing coverage
    data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and provides an overview of its design
    and capabilities. The primary intended purpose of the format is to enable data
    transfer between servers and web browsers, to support the development of interactive,
    data-driven web applications. Coverage data is a term that encompasses many kinds
    of data whose properties vary with space, time and other dimensions, including
    (but not limited to) satellite imagery, weather forecasts and river gauge measurements.
    We describe the motivation and objectives of the format, and provide a high-level
    overview of its structure and semantics. We compare CoverageJSON with other coverage
    formats and data models and provide links to tools and libraries that can help
    users to produce and consume data in this format. This Note does not attempt to
    describe the full CoverageJSON specification in detail: this is available at the
    project website.'
