abstract:
- content: This discussion paper is a draft new topic volume for the OGC Abstract
    Specification, which may also be used to propose a corresponding new standard
    to ISO/TC 211. This document proposes extensions to OGC Abstract Specification
    Topic 2 — Spatial referencing by coordinates, and thus to ISO 19111 — Spatial
    referencing by coordinates. This discussion paper is posted for comments on the
    contents. Revision of this draft is planned, to improve some details while supporting
    the same abilities.
