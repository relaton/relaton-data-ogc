abstract:
- content: "Applications using moving feature data, typically on vehicles and pedestrians,
    have\r\nrecently been rapidly increasing. Innovative applications are expected
    to require the\r\noverlay and integration of moving feature data from different
    sources to create more\r\nsocial and business values. Efforts in this direction
    should be encouraged by ensuring\r\nsmoother data exchange because handling and
    integrating moving feature data will\r\nbroaden the market for geo-spatial information.
    This discussion paper provides an\r\noverview of some actual and potential geo-spatial
    applications using moving feature data\r\nand the existing international standards
    or specifications on moving feature data handling.\r\nIt also summarizes the requirements
    set on the standards for moving feature data, and\r\nfinally proposes the development
    of a new OGC standard for moving features."
