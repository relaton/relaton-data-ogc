abstract:
- content: "An important principle of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is the
    notion of composing capabilities provided by individual services into complex
    behavior. A requester should be able to compose a solution using functionality
    or data offered by multiple services without worrying about underlying differences
    in those services.\r\n\r\nEach OGC service is designed to offer a specific type
    of data product via a service-specific interface. This Engineering Report (ER)
    describes a single service interface that allows access to multiple data sources,
    possibly heterogeneous with respect to the types of data provided.\r\n\r\nThis
    report advances the work started in OGC Testbed 11 with the addition of heterogeneous
    data sources, as well as several other enhancements."
