abstract:
- content: "*THIS STANDARD HAS BEEN RETIRED*\r\n\r\nThe OpenGISÂ® Geographic Objects
    Interface Standard (GOS) provides an open set of common, lightweight, language-independent
    abstractions for describing, managing, rendering, and manipulating geometric and
    geographic objects within an application programming environment. It provides
    both an abstract object standard (in UML) and a programming-language-specific
    profile (in Java). The language-specific bindings serve as an open Application
    Program Interface (API)."
