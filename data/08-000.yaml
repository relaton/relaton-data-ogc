abstract:
- content: This report summarizes the work performed under the Canadian Geospatial
    Data Infrastructure Pilot. The purpose of this pilot was to test the utility of
    certain OGC standards, in particular the Geography Markup Language (GML) and Web
    Feature Service (WFS), in the implementation of a spatial data infrastructure.
    OGC documents 08-001 and 08-002 are more technical companions to this document.
