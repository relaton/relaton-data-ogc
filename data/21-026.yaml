abstract:
- content: "The Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) relies on two characteristics of the
    TIFF v6 format (tiles and reduced resolution subfiles), GeoTIFF keys for georeference,
    and the HTTP range, which allows for efficient downloading of parts of imagery
    and grid coverage data on the web and to make fast data visualization of TIFF
    or BigTIFF files and fast geospatial processing workflows possible. COG-aware
    applications can download only the information they need to visualize or process
    the data on the web. Numerous remote sensing datasets are available in cloud storage
    facilities that can benefit from optimized visualization and processing. This
    standard formalizes the requirements for a TIFF file to become a COG file and
    for the HTTP server to make COG files available in a fast fashion on the web.\r\n\r\nThe
    key work for crafting this OGC Standard was undertaken in the Open-Earth-Monitor
    Cyberinfrastructure (OEMC) project, which received funding from the European Union’s
    Horizon Europe research and innovation program under grant agreement number 101059548
    and in the All Data 4 Green Deal - An Integrated, FAIR Approach for the Common
    European Data Space (AD4GD) project, which received funding from the European
    Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation program under grant agreement number
    101061001."
