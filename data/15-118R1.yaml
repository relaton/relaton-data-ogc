abstract:
- content: "The Incident Management Information Sharing (IMIS) Internet of Things
    (IoT) Pilot established the following objectives:\r\n\r\n•        Apply OGC principles
    and practices for collaborative development to existing standards and technology
    to prototype an IoT approach to sensor use for incident management;\r\n\r\n•        Employ
    an agile methodology for collaborative development of system designs, specifications,
    software and hardware components of an IoT-inspired IMIS sensor capability;\r\n\r\n•
    \       Develop profiles and extensions of existing Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)
    and other distributed computing standards to provide a basis for future IMIS sensor
    and observation interoperability; and\r\n\r\n•        Prototype capabilities documented
    in engineering reports and demonstrated in a realistic incident management scenario.\r\n\r\nBased
    on the findings gathered during the implementation and work on these objectives,
    this Engineering Report describes recommendations on profiles for OGC Web services
    that shall be used to build IMIS systems."
