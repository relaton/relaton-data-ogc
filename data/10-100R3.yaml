abstract:
- content: "This approved OGC Implementation Standard defines a Simple Features profile
    of the Geography Markup Language version 3.2. This Simple Features Profile has
    been aligned with the OGC Simple Features standard for SQL version 1.2. Simple
    Features include: Point, Curve (LineString), Surface (Polygon), Geometry, MultiPoint,
    MultiCurve, MultiSurface, and MultiGeometry. The detailed abstract model for OGC
    features and geometry can be found in the OGC Abstract Specification, Topic Volume
    1: Features (which is equivalent to ISO 19107).\r\n\r\nThis Simple Features profile
    of GML began as a product of OGC’s Interoperability Program: a global, collaborative,
    hands-on engineering and testing program designed to deliver prototype technologies
    and proven candidate standards into the OGC’s Specification Development Program.
    In OGC Interoperability Initiatives, international teams of technology providers
    work together to solve specific geo-processing interoperability problems posed
    by Initiative. \r\n"
