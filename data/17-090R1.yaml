abstract:
- content: The recently published Underground Infrastructure Concept Development Study
    (UICDS) Engineering Report [1] examines the present state of underground infrastructure
    information (UGII), costs and benefits of that state, as well as future opportunities
    for an improved state. That report describes a number of candidate models for
    UGII and recommends a number of follow-on activities, including development of
    a prototype UGII integration model to support subsequent UGII integration and
    exchange initiatives. The present report describes the design and development
    of conceptual UGII integration model MUDDI (Model for Underground Data Definition
    and Interchange). The goal of MUDDI is not to replace existing models but to serve
    as the basis for integration of datasets from different models, at the levels
    of detail required to address application use cases described in [1]. MUDDI as
    described here is a conceptual model which will serve as the basis for one or
    more conformant and interchangeable physical implementations such as GML (Geographic
    Markup Language) or SFS (Simple Features SQL). As a prototype model, the current
    version of MUDDI is also not intended to be final, but to serve as an input to
    the proposed OGC Underground Infrastructure Pilot and similar activities which
    will in turn serve to refine and improve the model through implementation and
    deployment in realistic application scenarios.
