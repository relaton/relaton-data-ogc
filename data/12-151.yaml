abstract:
- content: This document provides an overview of the portrayal work within the OWS-9
    Aviation thread. Using open standards, a web services architecture was designed
    and prototyped to enable the retrieval of static airport maps in support of an
    ePIB. An ePIB, or Digitally Enhanced Pre-Flight Information Bulletin, provides
    the pilot with an easy-to-interpret representation of any relevant aeronautical
    and meteorological events that are likely to affect the flight, expressed as Digital
    NOTAMs. The static airport maps are an important part of an ePIB and should provide
    a graphical representation of the status of departure and arrival airports, showing
    only NOTAMs relevant to the particular context and represented geographically
    so that the effect of the NOTAM is clear. This approach avoids the pilot scanning
    through pages of textual description for potentially relevant NOTAMs, reducing
    the workload and the risk of missing a critical piece of information.
