abstract:
- content: This report details the results of the OGC Building Energy Mapping and
    Analysis Concept Development Study (BEMA CDS). Sponsored by NRCan and drawing
    on numerous previous studies, the CDS released a Request for Information on building
    energy data and applications. The responses were presented and validated in 3
    public workshops and form the basis for an Energy SDI notional architecture.
