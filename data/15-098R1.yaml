abstract:
- content: "The Geospatial User Feedback XML encoding standard is based on the OGC
    Geospatial User Feedback conceptual model [OGC 15-097]. Geospatial User Feedback
    (GUF) is metadata that is predominantly produced by the consumers of geospatial
    data products based on their use and experience with those products. This standard
    complements the existing metadata conventions whereby documents recording dataset
    characteristics and production workflows are generated by the creator, publisher,
    or curator of a data product. As a part of metadata, the GUF data model internally
    reuses some elements of ISO 19115-1 (the updated version of the OGC Abstract Specification
    Topic 11) but not the general structure. This selective use of ISO metadata elements
    prioritizes future interoperability with developing ISO metadata models.\r\nThis
    standard can be used in combination with the OGC 15-097 Conceptual Model Standard.
    In the future, other encodings may be considered, being an alternative using the
    JSON-LD encoding based on parts of schema.org.\r\n"
