abstract:
- content: "The OGC Points of Interest (POI) Conceptual Model is an open data model
    for representing information about POI. The model is defined using a Unified Modeling
    Language (UML) object model. This UML model extends the ISO Technical Committee
    211 (TC211) conceptual model standards for spatial and temporal data. Building
    on the ISO foundation assures that the features described in the POI Model share
    the same spatiotemporal universe as described by related standards (e.g., CityGML).\r\n\r\nThe
    goal for developing the OGC POI Conceptual Model is to reach a common definition
    of the basic entities, attributes, and relations of “points of interest.” In the
    broadest terms, a POI is a location about which information of general interest
    is available. “A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates and an identifier,
    or more complex such as a three-dimensional model of a building with names in
    various languages, information about open and closed hours, and a civic address.”
