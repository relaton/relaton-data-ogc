abstract:
- content: This Engineering Report describes an extension for storing Releasable Basemap
    Tiles (RBT) in GeoPackage developed during an OGC Code Sprint initiative sponsored
    by the US Army Geospatial Center (AGC) which took place in March 2024. During
    this initiative, participants Ecere Corporation, Compusult Limited and TechMaven
    Geospatial, assembled into this single extension document draft extensions developed
    in previous OGC initiatives for storing vector tiles, semantic annotations and
    portrayal styles in GeoPackages. Minor updates and clarifications to the requirements
    of these draft extensions were made based on additional experimentation performed
    during the sprint. Additional requirements and recommendations were also introduced
    for this extension, including requirements specific to RBT content, a recommendation
    to include fonts used by styles, requirements to support compressed vector tiles,
    as well as requirements further restricting how to store vector tiles in the context
    of this extension to improve interoperability.
