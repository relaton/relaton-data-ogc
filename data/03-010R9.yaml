abstract:
- content: This OpenGIS Recommendation Paper specifies basic XML encoding of data
    defining coordinate reference systems and coordinate operations. This encoding
    is expected to be adapted and used by multiple OGC Implementation Specifications,
    by the separate specification of Application Schemas. This document is a Recommendation
    Paper because the specified encoding is more general than an OpenGIS Implementation
    Specification and more specific than the OpenGIS Abstract Specification.
