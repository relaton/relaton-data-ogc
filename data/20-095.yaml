abstract:
- content: "This OGC Best Practice was developed by the Defence Geospatial Information
    Working Group to address defense and intelligence user community requirements.
    As such, the Best Practice utilizes standardized military Coordinate Reference
    System (CRS) definitions, which may not be applicable to other user communities.\r\nThis
    Best Practice also defines a GEO_METADATA tag, which may be of more general interest.\r\n"
