abstract:
- content: "This OGC® Best Practices document specifies the interfaces, bindings,
    requirements,\r\nconformance classes for online download of Earth Observation
    products. This protocol\r\ncovers several scenarios implemented by European Space
    Agency - ESA for providing its\r\nproducts to users:\r\n- The EO Product to be
    downloaded is already available and can be downloaded as\r\nit is.\r\n- The EO
    Product is not online available but is stored in a near online archive.\r\n- The
    EO Product is advertised in a Catalogue, but it is not physically available and\r\nit
    has to be generated on the fly by a processing facility.\r\n- The EO product is
    archived in several distributed online archives and it can be\r\ndownloaded in
    parallel.\r\nThe basic scenarios can be simply supported by Web Browsers, the
    most complex ones\r\nneed a dedicated client (download manager) supporting Metalink
    and multisource\r\ndownload.\r\nThis Best Practice document has been prepared
    basing on the work performed in the\r\nframe of ESA’s Next Generation Earth Observation
    user services and it was initially\r\nproduced during the ESA"
