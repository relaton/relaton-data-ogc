abstract:
- content: "At the time of finalizing this ER the OGC TC has approved the OWS Context
    JSON encoding that is available here: http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/owc
    This is the second encoding proposed for the OWS context standard precided by
    the Atom Encoding [OGC 12-084r2]. The OWS Context JSON enconding is based on the
    GeoJSON IETF standard [RFC7946]. The standard is a combination of two approaches:\r\n\r\nmapping
    between the OWS Context conceptual model [12-080r2] to the basic structure of
    a GeoJSON file.\r\n\r\na direct conversion of the rest of the atom keys and the
    specific OWS Context XML into JSON following OGC 14-009r1.\r\n\r\nThe conversion
    was designed with current GeoJSON viewers in mind (including the one embedded
    in GitHUB) and making possible that they can visualize a OWS Context GeoJSON file
    without any modifications.\r\n\r\nThis ER focus on describing another encoding
    (a 3rd alternative) that allows for exposing geospatial resources on the web in
    a way that web browsers and search engines can better understand. It is widely
    known that HTML was designed with the linking capacity in mind. Both, users reading
    HTML and automatic crawlers, transverse links constantly. HTML seems the natural
    selection for linking geospatial data on the web. The question is how to complement
    the linking mechanism with some additional metadata that search engines could
    use for indexing. A solution could come from a mechanism which web search engines
    already have agreed to use for better indexing: schema.org.\r\n\r\nSchemna.org
    proposes three enconding for their data model: Microdata, RDFa and JSON-LD. The
    reader might easily get confused by the fact that OGC approved a JSON encoding
    for OWS context and another JSON encoding emerges in this document. This ER is
    NOT proposing to replace or modify the currently approved JSON enconding for OWS
    context based on GeoJSON. The intention is to map the OWS Context model into the
    schema.org model to recognize that they are very similar and propose a encoding
    in HTML5 that can be done in the 3 alternative proposed by schema.org.\r\n\r\n"
