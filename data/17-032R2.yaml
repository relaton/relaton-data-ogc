abstract:
- content: This OGCÂ® Engineering Report (ER) describes an Abstract Quality Model (AQM)
    for data in the aviation domain. Requirements for data quality in aviation are
    stringent, as the data is often used for safety critical purposes. The services
    considered are those that serve aeronautical information, flight information and
    weather forecasting. The model is built upon recognized standards of the International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO) with extensions and additions made according
    to the requirements of the domain. These requirements include an ability for the
    model to record information about the precision of measurements and an understanding
    of the timeliness of a piece of data, as information utility degrades with time.
    The result is an ISO compliant data quality model with the required extensions
    included.
