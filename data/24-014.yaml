abstract:
- content: "The primary focus of the SWE Common Data Model is to define and package
    data in a self-describing and semantically enabled way. The main objective is
    to achieve interoperability, first at the syntactic level, and later at the semantic
    level (by using ontologies and probably semantic mediation) so that (sensor) data
    can be better understood by machines, processed automatically in complex workflows
    and easily shared between intelligent nodes.\r\n\r\nThis standard is one of several
    implementation standards produced under OGC’s Connected Systems activity, and
    is a revision of content that was previously developed in the context of the Sensor
    Web Enablement initiative. These common data models are intended to be used in
    various OGC standards, and in particular, SensorML and OGC API — Connected Systems."
