abstract:
- content: "*RETIRED* This document focuses on the goals, objectives, capabilities
    and recommendation for the ESM Core Enterprise Service. The charter for this team
    was to address three fundamental questions:\r\n\r\n* What it Enterprise Service
    Management?\r\n* What can we buy or build today?\r\n* How should we invest for
    the future?\r\n\r\nThis paper responds to those questions by defining and describing
    ESM, discussing what is being done today, and what the group sees for the future
    of ESM?"
