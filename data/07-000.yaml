abstract:
- content: "The OpenGISÂ® Sensor Model Language Encoding Standard (SensorML) specifies
    models and XML encoding that provide a framework within which the geometric, dynamic,
    and observational characteristics of sensors and sensor systems can be defined.
    There are many different sensor types, from simple visual thermometers to complex
    electron microscopes and earth observing satellites. These can all be supported
    through the definition of atomic process models and process chains. Within SensorML,
    all processes and components are encoded as application schema of the Feature
    model in the Geographic Markup Language (GML) Version 3.1.1. This is one of the
    OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) [http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/markets-technologies/swe]
    suite of standards. For additional information on SensorML, see http://www.botts-inc.net/vast.html\r\n<!--
