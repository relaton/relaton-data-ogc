abstract:
- content: "This OGC Engineering Report documents the work performed by the participants
    of the Ocean Science Interoperability Experiment Phase II. This work is a follow-on
    to the OGC Oceans IE Phase 1 activity. Specifically, this IE addressed the following
    tasks:\r\n•\tAutomated metadata/software installation via PUCK protocol.\r\n•\tOffering
    of complex systems (e.g. observations systems containing other systems) such as
    collection of stations.\r\n•\tLinking data from SOS to out-of-band offerings.\r\n•\tSemantic
    Registry and Services.\r\n•\tCatalogue Service-Web Registry.\r\n•\tIEEE-1451/OGC-SWE
    harmonization\r\n\r\nAs a result of this experiment, a number of recommendations
    and conclusions were identified.\r\n"
