abstract:
- content: "The scenario of rapidly growing geodata catalogues requires tools focused
    on facilitating users the choice of products. Having populated quality fields
    in metadata allows the users to rank and then select the best fit-for-purpose
    products. For example, decision-makers would be able to find quality and uncertainty
    measures to take the best decisions as well as to perform dataset intercomparison.
    In addition, it allows other components (such as visualization, discovery, or
    comparison tools) to be quality-aware and interoperable.\r\n\r\nThis ER deals
    with completeness, logical consistency, positional accuracy, temporal accuracy
    and thematic accuracy issues to improve quality description in the metadata for
    imagery. Based on ISO 19157, UncertML and QualityML standardized measures, this
    ER describes how to encode quality measures in order to allow datasets comparison.
    Moreover, description of pixel-level quality measures is also included. Finally,
    alternatives to communicate tile level quality as well as mosaic products quality
    are proposed."
