abstract:
- content: "The CDB standard defines a standardized model and structure for a single,
    versionable, virtual representation of the earth. A CDB structured data store
    provides for a geospatial content and model definition repository that is plug-and-play
    interoperable between database authoring workstations.  Moreover, a CDB structured
    data store can be used as a common online (or runtime) repository from which various
    simulator client-devices can simultaneously retrieve and modify, in real-time,
    relevant information to perform their respective runtime simulation tasks. In
    this case, a CDB is plug-and-play interoperable between CDB-compliant simulators.
    \ A CDB can be readily used by existing simulation client-devices (legacy Image
    Generators, Radar simulator, Computer Generated Forces, etc.) through a data publishing
    process that is performed on-demand in real-time.\r\nThe application of CDB to
    future simulation architectures will significantly reduce runtime-source level
    and algorithmic correlation errors, while reducing development, update and configuration
    management timelines.  With the addition of the High Level Architecture - -Federation
    Object Model (HLA/FOM)  and DIS protocols, the application of the CDB standard
    provides a Common Environment to which inter-connected simulators share a common
    view of the simulated environment.\r\nThe CDB standard defines an open format
    for the storage, access and modification of a synthetic environment database.
    \ A synthetic environment is a computer simulation that represents activities
    at a high level of realism, from simulation of theaters of war to factories and
    manufacturing processes. These environments may be created within a single computer
    or a vast distributed network connected by local and wide area networks and augmented
    by super-realistic special effects and accurate behavioral models. SE allows visualization
    of and immersion into the environment being simulated . \r\nThis standard defines
    the organization and storage structure of a worldwide synthetic representation
    of the earth as well as the conventions necessary to support all of the subsystems
    of a full-mission simulator.  The standard makes use of several commercial and
    simulation data formats endorsed by leaders of the database tools industry. A
    series of associated OGC Best Practice documents define rules and guidelines for
    data representation of real world features.\r\nThe CDB synthetic environment is
    a representation of the natural environment including external features such as
    man-made structures and systems.  A CDB data store can include terrain relief,
    terrain imagery, three-dimensional (3D) models of natural and man-made cultural
    features, 3D models of dynamic vehicles, the ocean surface, and the ocean bottom,
    including features (both natural and man-made) on the ocean floor.  In addition,
    the data store can includes the specific attributes of the synthetic environment
    data as well as their relationships.\r\nThe associated CDB Standard Best Practice
    documents provide a description of a data schema for Synthetic Environmental information
    (i.e. it merely describes data) for use in simulation.  The CDB Standard provides
    a rigorous definition of the semantic meaning for each dataset, each attribute
    and establishes the structure/organization of that data as a schema comprised
    of a folder hierarchy and files with internal (industry-standard) formats.\r\nA
    CDB conformant data store contains datasets organized in layers, tiles and levels-of-detail.
    Together, these datasets represent the features of a synthetic environment for
    the purposes of distributed simulation applications.  The organization of the
    synthetic environmental data in a CDB compliant data store is specifically tailored
    for real-time applications.\r\n"
