abstract:
- content: "This document is a companion specification to the OpenGIS Web Map Service
    Interface Implementation Specification version 1.1.1 [4], hereinafter WMS 1.1.1.
    \r\nWMS 1.1.1 specifies how individual map servers describe and provide their
    map content.  The present Web Terrain Service specification describes a new operation,
    GetView, and extended Capabilities which allow a 3D terrain view image to be requested,
    given a map composition, a terrain model on which to drape the map, and a 3D viewpoint
    from which to render the terrain view. A simple attempt is also made to reconcile
    2D and 3D viewpoints by allowing the requested 3D area of view to be approximated
    with a WMS 1.1.1 bounding box"
