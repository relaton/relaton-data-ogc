abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 20 Report defines a draft OGC Specification for Geographic
    High Efficiency Image Format (GeoHEIF). The Report specifies requirements and
    encoding rules for using the High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) for the
    exchange of georeferenced or geocoded imagery. The GeoHEIF specification defines
    HEIF properties to include the georeference information in one or more image items.
    In addition, other HEIF properties are added to define the semantics of dimensions
    and cell properties that together allow for converting HEIF into a datacube container.\r\n\r\nPlease
    note that while the intent is to submit this document to the OGC for consideration
    as an OGC Standard, this document is internally referred to as an OGC Testbed
    20 Report or more simply “this Report” or “this specification”."
