abstract:
- content: "The portrayal and visualization of geospatial information is a critical
    task for facilitating decision making, situational awareness, and spatial analysis.
    However, despite its importance, various local, national, and international agencies
    continue to use different symbols and terminology for the same event, feature,
    or entity. This approach prevents interoperability from being extended to the
    semantic level, which in turn makes it difficult to share, reuse, and mediate
    unambiguous portrayal information between agencies.\r\n\r\nThis Engineering Report
    (ER) captures the requirements, solutions, models, and implementations of the
    Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Testbed-14 Portrayal thread. This effort leverages
    the work of the Portrayal Ontology development and the Semantic Portrayal Service
    conducted during Testbed 10, 11, 12 and 13. Thus far the emphasis for developing
    the portrayal ontologies (Testbeds 12 and 13) has been on modeling and representing
    portrayal information for feature data. The objective of Testbed-14 is to extend
    the portrayal ontology to accommodate more complex symbols (e.g., composite symbols)
    and to provide clear recommendations on how to best proceed with portrayal information
    encodings."
