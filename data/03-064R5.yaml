abstract:
- content: The GO-1 Application Objects specification defines a set of core packages
    that support a small set of Geometries, a basic set of renderable Graphics that
    correspond to those Geometries, 2D device abstractions (displays, mouse, keyboard,
    etc.), and supporting classes. Implementation of these APIs will support the needs
    of many users of geospatial and graphic information. These APIs support the rendering
    of geospatial datasets, provide fine-grained symbolization of geometries, and
    support dynamic, event and user driven animation of geo-registered graphics.
