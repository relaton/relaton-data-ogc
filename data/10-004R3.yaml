abstract:
- content: "This International Standard defines a conceptual schema for observations,
    and for features involved in sampling when making observations. These provide
    models for the exchange of information describing observation acts and their results,
    both within and between different scientific and technical communities. \r\nObservations
    commonly involve sampling of an ultimate feature of interest. This International
    Standard defines a common set of sampling feature types classified primarily by
    topological dimension, as well as samples for ex-situ observations. The schema
    includes relationships between sampling features (sub-sampling, derived samples).
    \r\nThis International Standard concerns only externally visible interfaces and
    places no restriction on the underlying implementations other than what is needed
    to satisfy the interface specifications in the actual situation. \r\n"
