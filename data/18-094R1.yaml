abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report (ER) enhances the understanding of the concept
    of application profiles (AP) for ontologies based on the Web Ontology Language
    (OWL) and used by Linked Data (LD) applications. The concept of an Application
    Profile for Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Extensible Markup Language (XML)
    schemas, in particular Geographic Markup Language (GML) application profiles,
    is pretty well-defined and understood within the communities of Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Moreover,
    in the context of Linked Data and ontologies, the term is still ill-defined, as
    ontologies are defined using an Open World Assumption (OWA), as well as classes
    and properties are first-class modeling objects in ontology modeling. The work
    documented in this report includes:\r\n\r\nDefinition and characterization of
    Resource Description Framework (RDF) application profiles for simple linked data
    applications and complex analytic linked data applications.\r\n\r\nDetermination
    of preliminary techniques for the development of subsets of ontologies to support
    different types of applications (simple linked data and complex analytic)\r\n\r\nAn
    initial model for defining metadata about application profiles, so they can be
    searched and discovered by agents."
