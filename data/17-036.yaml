abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report (ER) documents the Geospatial Taxonomy research
    activities conducted by the Aviation (AVI) subthread of the Cross Community Interoperability
    (CCI) thread in OGC Testbed 13. One of the critical factors in the overall usability
    of services - and System Wide Information Management (SWIM) enabled services in
    particular - is the ability of a service to be discovered. The ability of a service
    to be discovered is assured by providing a uniformly interpretable set of service
    metadata that can be accessed by a service consumer through a retrieval mechanism
    (e.g., a service registry). Such a set of metadata (commonly referred to as a
    service description) has been defined by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
    and European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) and formalized
    in a Service Description Conceptual Model (SDCM) [SDCM].\r\n\r\nThe SDCM is currently
    used in standard service description documents and service registries by both
    FAA and EUROCONTROL. As part of the effort of enhancing service discovery, both
    organizations also use a number of categories that can be associated with all
    services and are generally referred to as taxonomies. The current set of taxonomies
    used by both EUROCONTROL and FAA categorizes (i.e., meta tags) services based
    on their availability status, interface model, data product, etc. However, despite
    the increasing role of OGC services in the SWIM environment, no taxonomies for
    categorizing services based on geographical coverage or other geospatial characteristics
    have been defined. This ER documents the work conducted as part of Testbed 13
    CCI thread and AVI subthread to identify and classify SWIM-enabled Service Oriented
    Architecture (SOA) services with geographical taxonomies and the integration thereof
    into SDCM."
