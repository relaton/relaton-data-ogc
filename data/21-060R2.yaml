abstract:
- content: "NOTE: OGC and ISO have aligned Coverages Standards; Topics 6.1 and 6.3
    are equivalent to ISO 19123-1 and 19123-3, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document
    defines, at a high, implementation-independent level, operations on coverages
    - i.e., digital representations of space-time varying geographic phenomena - as
    defined in ISO 19123-1. Specifically, regular and irregular grid coverages are
    addressed. Future versions will additionally support further axis types as well
    as further coverage types from ISO19123-1, such as point clouds and meshes in
    particular. While the core functionality is expected to be generic and applicable
    for any coverage, there may be special functionality for particular coverage types."
