abstract:
- content: This report documents the Second Environmental Linked Features Interoperability
    Experiment (SELFIE). SELFIE evaluated a proposed Web resource model and HTTP behavior
    for linked data about and among environmental features. The outcomes are building
    blocks to establish a system of real-world feature identifiers and landing pages
    that document them. OGC API - Features was found to be a useful component for
    systems implementing both landing content and representations of linked-features.
    More work is needed to establish best practices related to negotiation between
    varied representations of a feature, observations related to a feature, and for
    expressing and mediating between varied content from a given resource. These technical
    / meta-model details were found to be difficult to evaluate given the small number
    of example implementations and limited number of domain-feature models available
    for use with linked data.
