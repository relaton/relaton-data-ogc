abstract:
- content: 'This document describes the results of an OGC Interoperability Experiment
    (IE) on the portrayal of 3D geospatial information. It contains technical details
    on processing 3D information in an OGC service environment as well as best practices
    on how to portray large data sets in urban planning scenarios, taking into account
    architectures and capabilities of interactive 3D graphics. Especially Web 3D Service
    and Web View Service, two draft standards (published as OGC discussions paper),
    have been in the focus of 3DPIE. '
