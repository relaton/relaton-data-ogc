abstract:
- content: "Improving discoverability of open geo-data and information is vital to
    increasing the use of these data in- and outside the geospatial expert community.
    \r\nIn this document we start to compare existing metadata standards, e.g., Dublin
    Core, ISO 19115/57/19, and INSPIRE, in the geospatial- and open data context.
    We also describe related linked open data initiatives such as RDF, SPARQL, and
    metadata publication initiatives, e.g., schema.org and Atom feeds. GeoDCAT is
    an initiative with the potential to integrate DCAT metadata as they are used in
    the open data and e-government community with EN ISO 19115/57/19 standards and
    INSPIRE metadata as they are used in the Geospatial community. GeoDCAT has - because
    it is based on RDF- the ability to publish metadata directly on the web without
    open and geospatial data portals.\r\nTo respond to the interest of different communities
    to preserve geospatial metadata resources and to support the uptake of GeoDCAT-AP
    implementations, best practices from different countries were identified and studied.
    The best practice cases focus on four domains (focus areas): metadata input (manually
    or automatically harvested), metadata publication into an integrated geo/open
    data portal, publication of metadata as Linked Open Data (LOD), and information
    mapping (ISO 19115, INSPIRE, DCAT, etc.).\r\nGeoDCAT-AP is a mature solution for
    mapping metadata from the open data and geospatial domain. GeoDCAT helps to integrate
    and to publish metadata in data portals and directly on the world wide web. To
    conclude a GeoDCAT alignment exercise has been done with ISO 19115/19 and INSPIRE
    to improve the open data and geospatial metadata alignment in the future.\r\n"
