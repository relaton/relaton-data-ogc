abstract:
- content: "The Security Engineering Report (ER) covers two Testbed 13 topics:\r\n\r\nThe
    implementation of authentication and authorization plugins for the QGIS open source
    desktop GIS client and\r\n\r\nthe implementation of secured workflow.\r\n\r\nThe
    authentication plugins implement the SAML2 ECP with PAOS binding and IdP discovery
    from the SAML2 federation metadata URL. The access right delegation plugin implements
    applicable OAuth2 grant types.\r\n\r\nRegarding the first topic, this ER discusses
    the fit for purpose aspects for the OAuth2 and SAML2 in the context of an open
    source desktop application. It also covers the QGIS development as well as building
    and deployment aspects. Most of the work related to this topic was provided by
    Secure Dimensions.\r\n\r\nRegarding the second topic, this ER outlines the architecture
    approach and the implications to implementations for security in OGC service workflows
    as well as the implementation approach itself. Most of the work related to this
    topic was provided by 52Â°North."
