abstract:
- content: "Tiled feature data, colloquially referred to as 'vector tiles', can be
    used to optimize the delivery of vector data over the web. This data may subsequently
    be used to support visualization (particularly through maps) as well as limited
    analysis activities. One goal of the OGC Vector Tiles Pilot was to define candidate
    extensions to existing OGC standards as a way to advance the use of vector tiles
    technology as part of the OGC baseline. This Engineering Report (ER) describes
    a set of possible extensions to GeoPackage 1.2 that documents the mechanism to
    store and retrieve vector tiles in a GeoPackage. These extensions work together
    to enable a GeoPackage to act as a container format that can support visualization
    and analysis activities, even in a Denied, Degraded, Intermittent, or Limited
    Bandwidth (DDIL) environment.\r\n\r\nThe GeoPackage Vector Tiles extensions define
    the rules and requirements for encoding vector tiles in a GeoPackage data store.
    There are five draft extensions:\r\n\r\nThe Vector Tiles Extension provides vector
    tiles support through the GeoPackage tiles option.\r\n\r\nThe Mapbox Vector Tiles
    Extension allows the content of a tile Binary Large OBject (BLOB) to be a Mapbox
    Vector Tile as per version 2.1 of the Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT) specification [1].\r\n\r\nThe
    GeoJSON Vector Tiles Extension allows the content of each tile BLOB to be a GeoJSON
    file.\r\n\r\nThe OGC Web Services (OWS) Context Extension provides a way to store
    information describing a list of geospatial resources, including but not limited
    to maps, their layers, and the styles of those layers.\r\n\r\nThe Vector Tiles
    Attributes Extension allows attribute information for each feature to be stored
    in relational tables for more convenient querying.\r\n\r\nTo support vector tiles,
    a minimum of at least two extensions is required. The first extension enables
    vector tiles support. However, to be usable, an encoding format must be declared
    via either the second or third extension. The other extensions are purely optional.\r\n\r\nThese
    extensions, like all GeoPackage extensions, are intended to be transparent and
    to not interfere with GeoPackage-compliant, but non-supporting, software packages."
