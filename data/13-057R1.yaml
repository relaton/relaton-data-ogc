abstract:
- content: "This OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) – Transaction Extension (in short:
    WCS Transaction) defines an extension to the WCS Core [OGC 09-110] for updating
    coverage offer­ings on a server.\r\n\r\nThis WCS Transaction standard defines
    three requests:\r\n\r\nInsertCoverage for adding a coverage provided as parameter
    to the WCS server’s cov­erage offering. After successful completion of the insert
    request, this coverage will be accessible for all WCS operations.\r\nDeleteCoverage
    for entirely removing a coverage. The coverage is identified by its coverage id
    passed in the request, from the WCS server’s coverage offering. After successful
    completion of this request, this coverage will not be accessible through any WCS
    operation. However, subsequently a new coverage may be created using the same
    identifier; such a coverage will bear no relation to the one previously deleted.\r\nUpdateCoverage
    for modifying parts of a coverage existing in a WCS server’s coverage offering.
    The coverage is identified by its coverage id passed in the request. As per the
    OGC Coverage Implementation Schema [OGC 09-146r2], all updates must maintain internal
    consistency of the coverage.\r\nAll requests defined in this Transaction Extension
    adhere to the ACID[1] (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) concepts
    of database transactions.\r\n\r\nThe extension name, Transaction, traces back
    to the database concept of transactions, which has been adopted here."
