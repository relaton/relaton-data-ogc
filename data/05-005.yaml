abstract:
- content: "This document is a companion specification to the OGC Web Map Service
    Interface Implementation Specification version 1.1.1 [4], hereinafter WMS 1.1.1.
    \r\nWMS 1.1.1 specifies how individual map servers describe and provide their
    map content.  The present Context specification states how a specific grouping
    of one or more maps from one or more map servers can be described in a portable,
    platform-independent format for storage in a repository or for transmission between
    clients.  This description is known as a Web Map Context Document, or simply a
    Context.  Presently, context documents are primarily designed for WMS bindings.
    However, extensibility is envisioned for binding to other services.\r\nA Context
    document includes information about the server(s) providing layer(s) in the overall
    map, the bounding box and map projection shared by all the maps, sufficient operational
    metadata for Client software to reproduce the map, and ancillary metadata used
    to annotate or describe the maps and their provenance for the benefit of human
    viewers.\r\nA Context document is structured using eXtensible Markup Language
    (XML).  Annex A of this specification contains the XML Schema against which Context
    XML can be validated.\r\n "
