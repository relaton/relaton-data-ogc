abstract:
- content: "The OGC API — Environmental Data Retrieval (EDR) standard provides a family
    of lightweight query interfaces to access spatiotemporal data resources by requesting
    data at a Position, within an Area, along a Trajectory or through a Corridor.
    A spatio-temporal data resource is a collection of spatio-temporal data that can
    be sampled using the EDR query pattern geometries. These patterns are described
    in the section describing the Core Requirements Class.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the
    EDR Application Programming Interface (API) that is specified by this standard
    are to:\r\n\r\nMake it easier to access a wide range of data through a uniform,
    well-defined simple Web interface;\r\n\r\nTo achieve data reduction to just the
    data needed by the user or client while hiding much of the data storage complexity.\r\n\r\nA
    major use case for the EDR API is to retrieve small subsets from large collections
    of environmental data, such as weather forecasts, though many other types of data
    can be accessed. The important aspect is that the requested data can be unambiguously
    specified by spatio-temporal coordinates.\r\n\r\nThe EDR API query patterns — Position,
    Area, Cube, Trajectory or Corridor — can be thought of as discrete sampling geometries,
    conceptually consistent with the feature of interest in the Sensor Observation
    Service (SOS) standard. A typical data resource accessed by an EDR API instance
    is a multidimensional dataset that could be accessed via an implementation of
    the Web Coverage Service (WCS) standard. In contrast to SOS and WCS, the EDR API
    is fully consistent with the patterns of the OGC API family of standards and aims
    to provide a single set of simple-to-use query patterns. Use cases for EDR range
    from real or virtual time-series observation retrievals, to sub-setting 4-dimensional
    data cubes along user-supplied sampling geometries. These query patterns do not
    attempt to satisfy the full scope of either SOS or WCS, but instead provide useful
    building blocks to enable the composition of APIs that satisfy a wide range of
    geospatial data use cases. By defining a small set of query patterns (and no requirement
    to implement all of them), the EDR API should help to simplify the design of systems
    (as they can be performance tuned for the supported queries) making it easier
    to build robust and scalable infrastructures.\r\n\r\nWith the OGC API family of
    standards, the OGC community has extended its suite of standards to include Resource
    Oriented Architectures and Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These
    standards are based on a shared foundation, specified in OGC API-Common, which
    defines the resources and access paths that are supported by all OGC APIs. The
    resources are listed in Table 1. This document extends that foundation to define
    the EDR API."
