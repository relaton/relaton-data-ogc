abstract:
- content: 'This Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard defines the conceptual
    model for the OGC CDB Standard. The objective of this document is to provide an
    core conceptual model for a CDB data store (repository). The model is represented
    using UML (Unified Modeling Language). The conceptual model is comprised of concepts,
    schema, classes and categories as well as their relationships, which are used
    to understand, and/or represent an OGC CDB data store. This enables a comparison
    and description of the CDB data store structure on a more detailed level. This
    document was created by reverse-engineering the UML diagrams and documentation
    from the original CDB submission OGC Common DataBase Volume 1 Best Practice, 2015
    as a basis for supporting OGC interoperability. One of the important roles of
    this conceptual model is to provide a UML model that is consistent with the other
    OGC standards and to identify functional gaps between the current CDB data store
    and the OGC standards baseline. This document references sections of Volume 1:
    OGC CDB Core Standard: Model and Physical Database Structure [OGC 15-113r5].'
