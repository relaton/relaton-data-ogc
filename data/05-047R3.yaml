abstract:
- content: "The OpenGIS® GML in JPEG 2000 for Geographic Imagery Encoding Standard
    defines the means by which the OpenGIS® Geography Markup Language (GML) Standard
    http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml is  used within JPEG 2000 http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000/
    \ images for geographic imagery. The standard also provides packaging mechanisms
    for including GML within JPEG 2000 data files and specific GML application schemas
    to support the encoding of images within JPEG 2000 data files. JPEG 2000 is a
    wavelet-based image compression standard that provides the ability to include
    XML data for description of the image within the JPEG 2000 data file. \r\nSee
    also the GML pages on OGC Network: http://www.ogcnetwork.net/gml .\r\n"
