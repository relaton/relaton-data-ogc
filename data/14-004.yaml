abstract:
- content: 'This document an interoperable hydrology profile for OGC Sensor Observation
    Service (SOS) 2.0 implementations serving OGC WaterML 2.0. This development is
    based on previous activities and results (i.e. Hydrology Interoperability Experiments
    as well as the European FP7 project GEOWOW). It is guided by the need to overcome
    mostly semantic issues between different SOS instances serving hydrological data
    and the according clients. Therefore, this profile focuses on how to use the entities
    and requests of the standards and covers the necessary technical details. '
