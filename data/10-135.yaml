abstract:
- content: The SPS 2.0 Earth Observation Satellite Tasking Extension Standard specifies
    extensions to the OGC Sensor Planning Service (SPS) 2.0 Interface Standard. The
    SPS configuration proposed in this extension is intended to support the programming
    process of Earth Observation (EO) sensor systems. This standard describes a consistent
    SPS configuration that can be supported by many satellite data providers, most
    of whom have existing facilities for the management of these programming requests.
    The resulting extended web service interface can be used for determining the feasibility
    of an intended sensor planning request, for submitting such a request, for inquiring
    about the status of such a request, for updating or canceling such a request,
    and for requesting information on means of obtaining the data collected by the
    requested task.
