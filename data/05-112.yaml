abstract:
- content: "This document describes Symbology Management System which is a system
    closely related to OpenGIS Style Management Services (SMS) (described in the document
    OGC 04-040). Having in mind their identical purpose, the system described in this
    document will also be referred to as SMS.\r\nThe SMS manages styles and symbols
    and defines their use in the process of producing maps from source GML data.\r\n"
