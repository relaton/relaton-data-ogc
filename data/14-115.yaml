abstract:
- content: "This White Paper supports development of a Smart Cities Spatial Information
    Framework\r\nbased on these themes:\r\nK Smart Cities are high-density generators
    of innovation and information.\r\nK Location information is a major enabler of
    Smart City technology benefits.\r\nK Benefits of smart technology must be judged
    by benefits to residents.\r\nK Reuse and repurpose is vital to urban resilience\r\nK
    Open standards are needed for interoperability, efficiency, application innovation\r\nand
    cost effectiveness.\r\nDiscussion of these themes and this white paper will occur
    at the OGC Smart Cities\r\nLocation Powers Summit in Tokyo on December 2, 2014,\r\n1
    the co-located OGC Technical\r\nCommittee meeting, and in many other forums in
    the future. As described in this paper,\r\nthere are many standards initiatives
    that focus on Smart Cities. Most Smart Cities use\r\ncases in some way involve
    indoor and/or outdoor location, and thus communication about\r\nlocation is an
    issue that cuts across the work programs most of the standards\r\norganizations
    that are involved with Smart Cities.\r\nThis white paper builds on the OGC - Directions
    Magazine webinar: “Making Location\r\nWork for Smart Cities – the Case for Location
    Standards”2."
