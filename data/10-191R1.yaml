abstract:
- content: This OpenGISÂ® Discussion Paper presents a Multilayered Space-Event Model
    for indoor navigation which simultaneously addresses route planning, multiple
    localization methods, navigation contexts, and different locomotion types. The
    paper contains the corresponding data models as well as their encoding in GML
    3.1.1.
