abstract:
- content: "A number of OGC service interface standards define SOAP bindings. Despite
    the current hype around REST or RESTful interfaces, SOAP services are still used
    intensively, in particular in security-critical environments. A number of OGC
    Web service interfaces support SOAP bindings (see chapter 6). Unfortunately, those
    bindings are not fully consistent across the suite of OGC service standards. Differences
    can be found in terms of SOAP versions, used namespaces, error handling, capabilities
    documentation, or transport of non-XML data; i.e. aspects that should be harmonized
    by a cross-standard working group. \r\nThis document seeks to provide an overview
    of the current situation and guidance on future SOAP harmonization across all
    OGC Web services. A number of change requests have been developed during the development
    process for this document. Though this document provides recommendations in chapter
    8, it is highly recommended to either form a new SOAP working group, or preferably
    to assign the development of SOAP best practices to reduce the risk of missed
    requirements and architecture arguments to the newly reformed OWS Common SWG.
    The best practices could then be applied to all OGC service standards that offer
    SOAP bindings.\r\n"
