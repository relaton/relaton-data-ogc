abstract:
- content: "The OGC API — Discrete Global Grid Systems — Part 1: Core Standard defines
    requirements that can be implemented and integrated into a deployed Web API. The
    DGGS API allows to retrieve geospatial data for a specific area, time and resolution
    of interest, based on a specific DGGRS. Additionally, the DGGS API defines operations
    to query the list of DGGRS zones from which data is available and/or matching
    a specified query. Such queries are expressed by combining HTTP query parameters,
    including the possibility to express more complex filtering queries using the
    OGC Common Query Language (CQL2).\r\n\r\nReaders are strongly encouraged to first
    familiarize themselves with the DGGS concepts defined in OGC Abstract Specification
    Topic 21 laying the foundation for this Standard.\r\n\r\nPlease note that in the
    remainder of this document, the Standard will be referred to as the “OGC API –
    DGGS Standard”, “the DGGS API” or “this Standard”."
