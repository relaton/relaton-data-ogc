abstract:
- content: "The OGC Compliance Program provides a free online testing facility based
    on TeamEngine and a set of test suites dedicated to specific protocols and versions,
    as well as specification profiles and extension.\r\n\r\nThis document reviews
    the work that has been carried out as part of the Testbed-14 compliance activity,
    in particular covering the development of:\r\n\r\nA Web Feature Service (WFS)
    3 core test suite, covering both the tests and the reference implementation servers\r\n\r\nA
    Defence Geospatial Information Working Group CATalog (DGIWG CAT) 2.0 extension
    for the Catalog Services for the Web 2.0.2 (CSW) test suite and server reference
    implementation\r\n\r\nThe WFS 3.0 protocol is the next iteration of the WFS specification,
    focusing on open specification, ease of implementation, and modern Representational
    State Transfer (REST) Application Program Interface (API) approaches.\r\n\r\nThe
    DGIWG CAT is an application profile of the CSW, which allows to query and get
    metadata following the DGIWG application profile of the ISO19139 standard, which
    augments the metadata elements to include information relevant to the defense
    organizations.\r\n\r\nBoth the test suites are meant to be run by the Test, Evaluation,
    And Measurement (TEAM) Engine and eventually land on the OGC beta compliance test
    engine (availability on the primary site is subject to the WFS 3.0 specification
    being finalized and the tests being adapted to it)."
