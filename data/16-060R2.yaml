abstract:
- content: This OGC standard is a profile of the OGC GML Application Schema - Coverages
    version 1.0 [OC 09-146r2]. That document was renamed OGC Coverage Implementation
    Schema (CIS) for clarification in version 1.1. This standard specifies the usage
    of the GRIB2 data format for the encoding of OGC coverages. The GRIB2 specification
    is maintained by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and is the standard
    encoding for the exchange and storage of general regularly distributed information
    expressed in binary form.
