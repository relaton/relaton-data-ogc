abstract:
- content: "The scope of this document is to capture considerations and recommendations
    on approaches for supporting georeferenceable imagery within the OGC encodings
    and web services. Georeferenceable imagery is typically imagery coming from a
    remote sensor that has not been previously geo-rectified, resampled, or regridded.
    Georeferenceable imagery must be accompanied with information sufficient to allow
    georectification of the imagery.\r\n"
