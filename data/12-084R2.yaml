abstract:
- content: "This standard describes the Atom encoding of the OWC Context conceptual
    model. The goal of this standard is to provide a definition of how to encode a
    context document, which can be extended to allow a context referencing a fully
    configured service set to be defined and consistently interpreted by clients.\r\n"
