abstract:
- content: "<p>This OGC standard specifies the Geo and Time extensions to the OpenSearch
    query protocol. OpenSearch is a collection of simple formats for the sharing of
    search results.</p>\r\n<p>The OpenSearch description document format can be used
    to describe a search engine so that it can be used by search client applications.
    The OpenSearch description format allows the use of extensions that allow search
    engines to request a specific and contextual query parameter from search clients.</p>\r\n<p>The
    OpenSearch response elements can be used to extend existing syndication formats,
    such as RSS and Atom, with the extra metadata needed to return search results.\r\nServices
    that support the OpenSearch Specification, the Geo and Time extensions defined
    in this document are called OpenSearch GeoTemporal Services.</p>\r\n"
