abstract:
- content: This OGC Engineering report details lessons learned and best practices
    defined as part of the Phase 1 Ocean Science Interoperability Experiment (Oceans
    IE). The Oceans IE was performed to investigate the use of OGC Web Feature Services
    (WFS) and OGC Sensor Observation Services (SOS) for representing and exchanging
    point data records from fixed in-situ marine platforms. The activity concluded
    that for the Oceans community use of in-situ sensors that the OGC Sensor Observation
    Services (SOS) was better suited than the use of OGC Web Feature Services (WFS)
    for this purpose.
