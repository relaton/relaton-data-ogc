abstract:
- content: "Landslides pose a significant threat, often triggered by extreme weather
    events like heavy \r\nrainfall or earthquakes, leading to extensive damage and
    loss of life. Traditional methods for \r\ndetecting and measuring landslides are
    typically time-consuming and lack accuracy. This report \r\nintroduces Landslideflow,
    a workflow based on the Common Workflow Language (CWL) \r\ndesigned to improve
    the detection and measurement of landslides. Utilizing remote sensing \r\ndata,
    such as satellite images and digital elevation models, Landslideflow generates
    precise \r\nlandslide displacement maps. The workflow is scalable and cloud-optimized,
    enabling it to \r\nhandle large data volumes efficiently. Moreover, Landslideflow
    leverages advanced computer \r\nvision and machine learning techniques to enhance
    accuracy, offering a robust solution that is \r\neasy to deploy on cloud platforms.
    As an open-source tool, Landslideflow is freely accessible, \r\nproviding a valuable
    resource for researchers and practitioners in the field. Landslideflow is a \r\npowerful
    tool for detecting and measuring landslides. It is accurate, scalable, cloud-optimized,
    \r\nand open source. Landslideflow can be used by scientists, engineers, and policymakers
    to better \r\nunderstand and mitigate the risks associated with landslides."
