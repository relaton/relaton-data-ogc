abstract:
- content: The Starfish Fungus Language was developed in response to the high number
    of complaints addressing issues with the OGC standard Sensor Model Language, SensorML.
    Most complaints circled around the high flexibility of the language in combination
    with unnecessary abstractions of technical terms, e.g. every sensor is not a sensor
    but a process. Most beginners struggled with the composite pattern of those processes,
    as there is no well-defined rule what needs to be described where. As a beginner,
    it is almost impossible to write a simple sensor description without getting major
    guidance through the SensorML development team or other experts.
