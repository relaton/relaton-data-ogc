abstract:
- content: "The OGC API — Processes — Part 1: Core Standard supports the wrapping
    of computational tasks into executable processes that can be offered by a server
    through a Web API and be invoked by a client application. The standard specifies
    a processing interface to communicate over a RESTful protocol using JavaScript
    Object Notation (JSON) encodings. The standard leverages concepts from the OGC
    Web Processing Service (WPS) 2.0 Interface Standard but does not require implementation
    of a WPS.\r\n\r\nBy way of background and context, in many cases geospatial or
    location data, including data from sensors, must be processed before the information
    can be effectively used. The WPS Standard provides a standard interface that simplifies
    the task of making simple or complex computational geospatial processing services
    accessible via web services. Such services include well-known processes found
    in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as well as specialized processes for spatiotemporal
    modeling and simulation. While the WPS standard was designed with spatial processing
    in mind, the standard could also be used to readily insert non-spatial processing
    tasks into a web services environment.\r\n\r\nThe OGC API — Processes Standard
    is a newer and more modern way of programming and interacting with resources over
    the web while allowing better integration into existing software packages. The
    OGC API — Processes Standard addresses all of the use cases that were addressed
    by the WPS Standard, while also leveraging the OpenAPI specification and a resource-oriented
    approach.\r\n\r\nThe resources that are provided by a server implementing the
    OGC API — Processes Standard are listed in Table 1 below and include information
    about the server, the list of available processes (Process list and Process description),
    jobs (running processes) and results of process executions."
