abstract:
- content: The OGC IndoorGML Part I – Conceptual Model Standard (this Standard) specifies
    an UML model for indoor information. Part 2 of the standard specifies technical
    implementation schemas in GML, SQL and JSON. While there are several standards
    supporting 3D modelling concepts such as CityGML, KML, IFC, LADM, and IMDF that
    deal with interiors of buildings from geometric, cartographic, and semantic viewpoints,
    IndoorGML focuses on modeling indoor spaces and their neighborhood relationships
    to support indoor location-based services. This document describes the conceptual
    model (Part 1) of IndoorGML that addresses spaces and networks for indoor navigation.
