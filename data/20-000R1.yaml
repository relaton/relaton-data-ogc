abstract:
- content: "This OGC Discussion Paper introduces the CityGML Urban Planning Application
    Domain Extension (ADE) published by the Japanese government for the i-Urban Revitalization
    (i-UR).\r\nThe i-UR is an information infrastructure dedicated for urban planning
    to contribute to data-driven urban development and urban revitalization. OGC KML
    has been utilized more than 10 years for i-UR, however, there were huge requirements
    for use of application-specific semantics information for urban planning and multi-scale
    structured information by LOD (Levels of Detail).\r\nBy using CityGML ADE mechanism,
    the Urban Planning ADE provides application-specific semantics information integrating
    with 3D geometry data to visualize and analyze the urban situation. Additionally,
    the Urban Planning ADE introduces newly extended LOD, LOD-1 (minus one) for nationwide
    city models and LOD-2 (minus two) for a worldwide city model to visualize global
    urban activities and study urban structure by integrating geospatial information
    and statistical grid information.\r\nThis paper describes a brief introduction
    of i-Urban Revitalization, data model of the Urban Planning ADE and data experiment
    examples to discuss further utilization of the Urban Planning ADE in urban planning
    applications.\r\n"
