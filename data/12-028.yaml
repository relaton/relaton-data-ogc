abstract:
- content: "The ISO 19107 spatial schema, which is implemented by GML, is very complex.
    ISO\r\n19107 defines an extensive list of geometries, geometric properties and
    operations â€“\r\nmany of which are not necessary for aeronautical information applications.
    In addition,\r\nthe ISO 19107 contains an exhaustive 3D geometry model that is
    probably not needed in\r\nits entirety for AIXM either. Therefore, a GML profile
    for AIXM needs to be defined.\r\nThe objective of this document is to identify
    the elements of the AIXM-GML profile and\r\nalso to provide guidelines for the
    use of GML constructs in AIXM data sets.\r\n"
