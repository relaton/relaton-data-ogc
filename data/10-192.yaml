abstract:
- content: 'Results of the Auth IE are presented in this Engineering Report document
    and serve as guidance to both implementers and organizations deploying solutions
    that involve basic authentication. It is the belief of the Auth IE participants
    that if such a document is made available to the community more OGC implementing
    products will natively support authentication. '
