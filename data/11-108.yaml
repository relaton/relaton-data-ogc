abstract:
- content: "This document describes the usability of OGC services and encodings to
    implement the\r\nOWS-8 observation fusion and tracking thread in an abstract way.
    The real deployment\r\nand an actual perspective on the engineering and technology
    viewpoint can be found in\r\nOWS-8 engineering report OGC 11-134, ‘OWS-8 Tracking:
    Moving Target Indicator\r\nProcess, Workflows and Implementation Results’. In
    addition, it describes an XMLSchema\r\nbased implementation of the UML information
    models defined in OWS-8\r\nengineering report “Information Model for Moving Target
    Indicators and Moving Object\r\nBookmarks” (OGC 11-113).\r\nThe report is also
    based on the results of the VMTI/GMTI and STANAG 4676 realization\r\nin the OGC
    concept of operations study; performed as part of OWS 8 and the EC cofunded\r\nresearch
    project Emergency Support System - ESS” (contract number 217951)."
