abstract:
- content: "MUDDI stands for “Model for Underground Data Definition and Integration”
    and is an approach to make sub-surface data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
    and Re-Usable.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a Conceptual Model of classes that
    allows the integration of datasets from different types of information about the
    underground space, using different information models. These information models
    include models about elements such as utility infrastructure, transport infrastructure,
    soils, ground water, or environmental parameters. The Conceptual Model is a superset
    of classes representing Real-World Objects that can be found in the Underground."
