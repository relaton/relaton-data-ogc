abstract:
- content: The WMS configuration proposed in this profile is intended to support the
    interactive visualization and evaluation of Earth Observation (EO) data products.  The
    profile sets out to describe a consistent Web Map Server (WMS) configuration that
    can be supported by many data providers (satellite operators, data distributors...),
    most of whom have existing (and relatively complex) facilities for the management
    of these data.
