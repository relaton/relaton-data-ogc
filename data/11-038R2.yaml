abstract:
- content: "This standard deals with enhancements to the netCDF (Network Common Data
    Form) data model for array-oriented scientific data..\r\nTwo important data models
    for netCDF are:\r\n- the “classic” netCDF model, used for netCDF-3 and earlier
    versions\r\n- an enhanced data model, used in netCDF-4 and later versions.\r\nThe
    netCDF classic data model is defined in OGC 10-091r3, “NetCDF Core.”\r\nThis document
    specifies a netCDF extension standard for the enhanced data model. The OGC netCDF
    encoding supports electronic encoding of geospatial data, specifically digital
    geospatial information representing space- and time-varying phenomena.\r\nNetCDF
    (network Common Data Form) is a data model for array-oriented scientific data.
    The netCDF classic data model is specified in the netCDF core specification. This
    standard specifies the enhanced data model. A freely distributed collection of
    access libraries implementing support for that data model in a machine-independent
    format are available. Together, the interfaces, libraries, and format support
    the creation, access, and sharing of multi-dimensional scientific data."
