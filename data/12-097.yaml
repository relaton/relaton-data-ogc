abstract:
- content: "This document provides a description of the Bulk Data Transfer investigations
    related to Geography Markup Language (GML) streaming and feature data transportation
    implemented in the OGC OWS-9 test bed.  \r\n\r\nThis document extends the concept
    of Bulk Data Transfer to the dissemination of large payloads consisting of geospatial
    data sets and/or collections of data sets between machines that are connected
    via a network.\r\n\r\nThis document also describes the delivery of large payloads
    consisting of geospatial data sets and/or collections of data sets to SpatiaLite/SQLite
    to store the data for use by mobile applications.\r\n"
