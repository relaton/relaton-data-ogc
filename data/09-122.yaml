abstract:
- content: NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a data model for array-oriented scientific
    data, a freely distributed collection of access libraries implementing support
    for that data model, and a machine-independent format. Together, the interfaces,
    libraries, and format support the creation, access, and sharing of scientific
    data.
