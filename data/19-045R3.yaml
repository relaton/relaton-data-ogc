abstract:
- content: This standard defines how to encode and share the various movements of
    geographic features by using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). It provides an
    alternative encoding for OGC Moving Features instead of that provided in the XML
    Core [OGC 14-083r2] and Simple CSV [OGC 14-084r2] standards. A moving feature,
    for instance a vehicle or a pedestrian, contains a temporal geometry whose location
    continuously changes over time and dynamic non-spatial attributes whose values
    vary with time. This Moving Features JSON encoding defines a set of keywords to
    implement the conceptual schema of moving features defined in ISO 19141:2008 [ISO
    19141:2008], accompanied with IETF GeoJSON Format [IETF RFC 7946].
