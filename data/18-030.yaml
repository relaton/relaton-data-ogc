abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report (ER) describes the development of compliance tests
    and their implementation in the OGC Test, Evaluation, And Measurement (TEAM) Engine
    to validate a clientâ€™s ability to make secure requests according to the OGC Web
    Services Security Candidate Standard. The goal of the candidate standard is to
    allow the implementation of Information Assurance (IA) controls and to advertise
    their existence in an interoperable way with minimal impact to existing implementations
    using a backward-compatible approach.\r\n\r\nThis ER covers the following topics
    from OGC Testbed-14 Compliance Interoperability & Testing Evaluation (CITE) thread:\r\n\r\ndeveloping
    a client validator to test compliance of client software with the OGC Web Services
    Security Candidate Standard\r\n\r\ncapturing the results of two use cases with
    different authentication methods\r\n\r\nmaking recommendations to the OGC Web
    Services Security Standards Working Group (SWG) based on the experiences made
    while developing the validator\r\n\r\n"
