abstract:
- content: 'The OpenGISÂ® Simple Features Interface Standard (SFS) provides a well-defined
    and common way for applications to store and access feature data in relational
    or object-relational databases, so that the data can be used to support other
    applications through a common feature model, data store and information access
    interface. OpenGIS Simple Features are geospatial features described using vector
    data elements such as points, lines and polygons.  '
