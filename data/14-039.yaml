abstract:
- content: "This activity is part of OGC Testbed 10. The aviation thread was focused
    on developing and demonstrating the use of the Aeronautical Information Exchange
    Model (AIXM) and the Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM), building on the
    work accomplished in prior testbeds to advance the applications of OGC Web Services
    standards in next generation air traffic management systems to support European
    and US aviation modernization programs.\r\nThis document provides the result of
    the Testbed 10 to assess the compliance between the OGC standards and the guidelines
    provided by the SAE  in their latest published document regarding portraying of
    NOTAMs. Specifically, the Human Based Portrayal of DNOTAM work attempts to fulfill
    the high level requirements identified in the OGC Testbed-10 RFQ Annex B .\r\nThe
    purpose of this investigation was to analyze the recommendations of the SAE comity
    and to evaluate the feasibility of their application using OGC standards for portraying,
    namely the Symbology Encoding standard, version 1.1.\r\n"
