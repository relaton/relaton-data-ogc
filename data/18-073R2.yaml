abstract:
- content: "The OGC PipelineML Conceptual and Encoding Model Standard defines concepts
    supporting the interoperable interchange of data pertaining to oil and gas pipeline
    systems. PipelineML supports the common exchange of oil and gas pipeline information.
    This initial release of the PipelineML Core addresses two critical business use
    cases that are specific to the pipeline industry: new construction surveys and
    pipeline rehabilitation. This standard defines the individual pipeline components
    with support for lightweight aggregation. Additional aggregation requirements
    such as right-of-way and land management will utilize the OGC LandInfra standards
    with utility extensions in the future. Future extensions to PipelineML Core will
    include (non-limitative): cathodic protection, facility and safety. PipelineML
    was advanced by an international team of contributors from the US, Canada, Belgium,
    Norway, Netherlands, UK, Germany, Australia, Brazil, and Korea.\r\n\r\nThis standard
    assumes the reader has a basic understanding of oil and gas pipeline industry
    concepts."
