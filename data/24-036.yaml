abstract:
- content: "The goal of the OGC Testbed 20 GeoDataCube (GDC) Provenance Demonstrator
    was to establish a standardized approach for exchanging metadata and provenance
    information in geospatial workflows. By utilizing the GDC API Profiles, this Testbed
    task demonstrated how transparency and reproducibility can be ensured, enabling
    users to access essential details about data sources and processing methods. This
    is particularly beneficial for both open science initiatives and restricted workflows,
    where traceability and accountability are crucial.\r\n\r\nA primary objective
    of this Testbed 20 task was to enhance the draft GDC API Profiles specification
    to enable seamless metadata and provenance exchange for GeoDataCubes. The work
    focused on improving interoperability by aligning with established metadata standards
    and enhancing the tracking of workflow identifiers, metadata definitions, and
    remote process chains. Additionally, the task participants aimed to refine STAC
    metadata to improve transparency in geospatial data processing.\r\n\r\nSupporting
    open science was another key objective, achieved through machine-readable outputs.
    Through these efforts, the GDC Provenance Demonstrator enhances the reproducibility
    of both scientific and restricted workflows while providing a reliable and standardized
    framework for geospatial data management."
