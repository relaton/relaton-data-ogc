abstract:
- content: "The SOS standard is applicable to use cases in which sensor data needs
    to be managed in an\r\ninteroperable way. This standard defines a Web service
    interface which allows querying\r\nobservations, sensor metadata, as well as representations
    of observed features. Further, this\r\nstandard defines means to register new
    sensors and to remove existing ones. Also, it defines\r\noperations to insert
    new sensor observations. This standard defines this functionality in a binding\r\nindependent
    way; two bindings are specified in this document: a KVP binding and a SOAP\r\nbinding."
