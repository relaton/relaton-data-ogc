- content: "This paper is intended to identify usability issues associated with use
    of OGC web\r\nmapping services that affect the quality of experience a user may
    have when accessing\r\nand using OGC web services and discuss potential solutions
    and guidance to address\r\nthese issues. Additionally, guidance on evaluating
    and self-assessing the Quality of\r\nExperience of Spatial Data Services will
    also be discussed and addressed with a proposal\r\nfor common assessment criteria
    and common practices for improving the user experience\r\nwhen viewing, layering
