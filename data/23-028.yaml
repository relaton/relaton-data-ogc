abstract:
- content: With the growing number of space assets and missions, the space industry
    needs a way to locate extra-terrestrial objects within the captured imagery. The
    current GeoTIFF Standard provides the location of terrestrial objects using TIFF
    tags. However, objects in space are relative to the observer and the distance
    of the objects in the imagery are often at great distances from the observer.
    Multiple objects can exist within the imagery which are at different spacetime
    locations in four dimensions. To further complicate the definition of the location,
    from a planar perspective, the edges of the image fade into infinity. With the
    use of spherical and gridded coordinates an image can tag pixels along the edge
    of a sphere or the camera location. The Testbed 19 Engineering Report (ER) extends
    GeoTIFF to work for all images including both terrestrial and non-terrestrial
    observations within the image.
