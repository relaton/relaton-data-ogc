abstract:
- content: The document describes the results of using OGC Web Services for accessing
    and using WXXM data, notably within aviation scenarios involving rerouting procedures
    motivated by the sudden closure of airspace areas caused by the eruption of a
    volcano. The focus of this document will be to evaluate the ability to encode
    and serve associated operational data with WXXM 1.1.1.
