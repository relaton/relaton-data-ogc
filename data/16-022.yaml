abstract:
- content: One practical purpose of this ER will be to describe how a conflation tool
    such as the Hootenanny software can be used for conflation tasks using the Web
    Processing Service interface. The developed WPS REST (conflation) Service will
    be described in detail. Special focus will be laid on more complex conflation
    tasks that include user interaction. During earlier testbeds, we connected different
    conflation tools to the WPS and performed different conflation tasks (see [1]
    and [2]). The experiences gathered there together with the ones gathered in the
    Testbed 12 will be captured in the ER. As the WPS REST (Conflation) Service will
    be RESTful, this ER could be the basis for a REST binding extension for WPS 2.0.
    Service profiles are an important aspect of the WPS 2.0 standard. We will investigate
    how a WPS 2.0 Conflation Profile could look like in the hierarchical profiling
    approach of WPS 2.0.
