abstract:
- content: "The primary focus of the Sensor Model Language (SensorML) is to provide
    a robust and\r\nsemantically-tied means of defining processes and processing components
    associated\r\nwith the measurement and post-measurement transformation of observations.
    This\r\nincludes sensors and actuators as well as computational processes applied
    pre- and postmeasurement.\r\nThe main objective is to enable interoperability,
    first at the syntactic level and later at the\r\nsemantic level (by using ontologies
    and semantic mediation), so that sensors and\r\nprocesses can be better understood
    by machines, utilized automatically in complex\r\nworkflows, and easily shared
    between intelligent sensor web nodes.\r\nThis standard is one of several implementation
    standards produced under OGC’s Sensor\r\nWeb Enablement (SWE) activity. This standard
    is a revision of content that was\r\npreviously integrated in the SensorML version
    1.0 standard (OGC 07-000)."
