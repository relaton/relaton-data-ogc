abstract:
- content: "This document describes the results of an experiment addressing issues
    relating to the application workflow processing incorporating a variety of OGC
    specifications. It details the inputs provided to the Open Geospatial Consortium's
    (OGC) OWS-3 Testbed and the architecture of the testbed related to the ESA Service
    Support Environment (SSE). \r\nIt is a formal deliverable of work package 6610
    of the Enhanced Service Infrastructure Technology (ESIT) project and is a joint
    Spacebel and Spot Image document.\r\n"
