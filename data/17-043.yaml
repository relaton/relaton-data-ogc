abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report (ER) describes the development of the compliance
    tests and implementation in GeoServer of the Web Feature Service (WFS) 2.0 and
    Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) 1.0 National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG)
    profiles. The NSG of the United States (US) National Geospatial Intelligence Agency
    (NGA) is the combination of technologies, policies, capabilities, doctrine, activities,
    people, data and communities needed to produce geospatial intelligence (GEOINT)
    in an integrated, multi-intelligence, multi-domain environment. The work can be
    grouped into four main topics:\r\n\r\ncritical review of the NSG profiles for
    WFS 2.0 and WMTS 1.0\r\n\r\nimplementation of the profiles in GeoServer\r\n\r\nvalidation
    of the implementation using OGC Compliance tests and tools\r\n\r\nlessons learn
    during the implementation of these profiles and their validation\r\n\r\nBoth NSG
    profiles are Class 2 profiles. WMTS profiles OGC WMTS 1.0. WFS profiles the DGIWG
    Profile of OGC WFS 2.0. The first topic provides a review of these profiles along
    with a description of the main extensions and restrictions introduced by them.\r\n\r\nThe
    second topic covers the implementation of the NSG profiles in GeoServer. It describes
    the software architecture and technical decisions, along with the deployment and
    configuration of the server.\r\n\r\nThe third topic covers the validation process
    of the implementation using OGC validation (sometimes referred to as CITE) tests
    and tools. It also covers how the tests can be run and how to configure GeoServer
    for these tests.\r\n\r\nThe last topic contains an evaluation of the work, reached
    goals, lessons learned and the best practices that can be applied in future work."
