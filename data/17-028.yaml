abstract:
- content: The goal of this ER is to summarize and compare the results from the activities
    dealing with asynchronous WFS responses in Testbed 13. Special focus will be given
    to the specific requirement for automatic notification of users if new or updated
    information becomes available and to the software components addressing these
    requirements, i.e. two asynchronous Web Feature Services (NG119 and NG120).
