abstract:
- content: "(RCS) data within a conformant CDB data store.  \r\nPlease note that the
    current CDB standard only provides encoding rules for using Esri ShapeFiles for
    storing RCS models. However, this Best Practice has been modified to change most
    of the ShapeFile references to “vector data sets” or “vector attributes” and “Point
    Shapes” to “Point geometries”. This was done in recognition that future versions
    of the CDB standard and related Best Practices will provide guidance on using
    other encodings/formats, such as OGC GML.\r\n"
