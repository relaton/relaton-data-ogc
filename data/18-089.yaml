abstract:
- content: "The OGC Indoor Mapping and Navigation Pilot Initiative was sponsored by
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Public Safety Communications
    Research (PSCR) Division. This initiative addressed key challenges related to
    indoor mapping and navigation for the purpose of supporting first responders in
    fields such as fire-fighting. The focus of this initiative was on developing the
    capabilities and workflows required for pre-planning operations. This included
    scanning each building to produce a point cloud dataset and converting this source
    data into various intermediate forms to support the generation of indoor navigation
    routes. This Engineering Report (ER) describes the work conducted in this initiative,
    the lessons learned captured by participants, and future recommendations to support
    the public safety efforts and interoperability of the standards. It is expected
    that future OGC initiatives will address the real-time, event-driven aspects of
    indoor mapping and navigation for first response situations.\r\n\r\nFirst responders
    typically survey high-risk facilities in their jurisdiction at least once per
    year as part of a pre-planning process. Pre-planning outputs are often in the
    form of reports, and first responders may generate their own hand-drawn maps during
    the process or annotate available floor plans (e.g., from computer-aided design
    models). Pre-planning is time-consuming, inefficient, and inherently complex considering
    the information and level of detail that should or could be captured, the lack
    of automation, and the difficulty identifying notable changes to facilities and
    infrastructure during successive pre-planning surveys.\r\n\r\nMobile three-dimensional
    (3D) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has been identified as a potentially
    transformational technology for first responders. Using LiDAR and 360-degree camera
    imagery, coupled with advanced software processing, first responders could efficiently
    capture 3D point clouds and a wealth of other information, both observed and derived,
    while walking through buildings as part of routine pre-planning operations. The
    use of 3D LiDAR and imagery has many potential upsides beyond just creating point
    clouds for visualization and mapping (e.g., use in localization, object classification,
    integration with virtual/augmented reality solutions, change detection, etc.)."
