abstract:
- content: The OGC Disaster Pilot 2021 initiative brought differing technologies together
    through multiple participants, allowing the future development of a robust solution
    with no single-point weaknesses. This Guide supports data providers in preparing
    and coordinating with others to leverage standards-based cloud computing platforms
    to support disaster management and response efforts. Geospatial data is acquired
    from multiple sources, including Earth Observation satellites, and converted to
    Decision Ready Information and indicators (DRI) from Analysis Ready Data and datasets
    (ARD) alongside recipes.
