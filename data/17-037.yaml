abstract:
- content: "This OGC document provides an analysis of the prototype implementations,
    approaches and performance aspects of data serialization techniques explored in
    OGC Testbed 13. Specifically, it describes work done during Testbed 13 investigating
    serialization for geospatial data sets on OGC Web Feature Service (WFS) using
    Google Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) and Apache Avro.\r\n\r\nProtocol buffers are
    Google’s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing
    structured data. They are described by Google in the following manner - 'think
    XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler'. With Protobuf Google indicates developers
    can define how they want their data to be structured once, then they can use special
    generated source code to easily write and read structured data to and from a variety
    of data streams and using a variety of languages. Apache Avro is described as
    a remote procedure call and data serialization framework developed within Apache’s
    Hadoop project. It uses JavaScript Object Notation(JSON) for defining data types
    and reportedly serializes data in a compact binary format."
