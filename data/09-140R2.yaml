abstract:
- content: The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC®) conducted a series of tests that
    examined the interoperability, suitability and performance of National System
    for Geospatial- Intelligence (NSG) Profiles provided by the National Geospatial-Intelligence
    Agency (NGA) of four OGC Standards, Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service
    (WFS), Web Coverage Service (WCS), and Catalog Service (CAT). In the study, vendors,
    users, and other interested parties conducted Technology Integration Experiments
    (TIEs) and mutually refined clients, services, interfaces and protocols in the
    context of a hands-on engineering experience expected to shape the future NGA,
    NSG and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) web based distribution.
