abstract:
- content: 'This strategic roadmap is a work product of a joint working group of buildingSMART
    International (bSI) and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). It is the latest
    attempt in a decade-long effort by these organizations to bridge the gap between
    building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS) to
    leverage open data standards and foster continuity of information across any business
    domain (e.g., environment, transportation, infrastructure, buildings) where both
    BIM and GIS data are needed for informed decision-making. The roadmap seeks to
    tap into the membership, activities, and reach of both organizations while at
    the same time aligning with other similar efforts within the larger industry to
    enhance infrastructure lifecycle management and support sustainable development. '
