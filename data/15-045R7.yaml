abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this Met Ocean profile of WCS2.1 is to define the metadata
    returned in the response documents resulting from the WCS2.1 operations: GetCapabilities,
    and DescribeCoverage; for use within the meteorological and oceanographic communities.
    It also defines the new operation DescribeCoverageCollection.\r\n\r\nThis work
    has been done by members of the OGC MetOcean Domain Working Group."
