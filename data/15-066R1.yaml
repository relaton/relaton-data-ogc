abstract:
- content: Over the past few years there has been an increase in the number, size
    and complexity of databases across government sectors. This has undoubtedly created
    challenges relating to the discovery and access of information and services on
    multiple databases across static and deployed networks. Linked Data has been suggested
    as a method able to tackle those challenges. The aim of the Hydrographic Linked
    Data activity in the OGC Testbed 11 was to advance the use of Linked Data for
    hydrographic data by building on the achievements of the previous testbeds and
    to improve the understanding of how to better build relations between hydro features
    and non-hydro features (e.g., stream gauge measurement/location vs bridge or other
    built features upstream or downstream). This aspect of the testbed focused on
    the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) which is published by the United States
    Geological Survey (USGS). This OGC Engineering Report provides guidelines on the
    publication of hydrographic and hydrological data serialized as Resource Description
    Framework (RDF) using Linked Data principles and technologies based on OGC standards.
    The document also presents the experimentation conducted by Testbed 11 in order
    to identify those guidelines.
