abstract:
- content: The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology is an ontology for describing
    sensors and their observations, the involved procedures, the studied features
    of interest, the samples used to do so, and the observed properties, as well as
    actuators. SSN follows a horizontal and vertical modularization architecture by
    including a lightweight but self-contained core ontology called SOSA (Sensor,
    Observation, Sample, and Actuator) for its elementary classes and properties.
    With their different scope and different degrees of axiomatization, SSN and SOSA
    are able to support a wide range of applications and use cases, including satellite
    imagery, large-scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructures,
    social sensing, citizen science, observation-driven ontology engineering, and
    the Web of Things. Both ontologies are described below, and examples of their
    usage are given.
