abstract:
- content: "The OpenGISÂ® Web Coverage Service Interface Standard (WCS) defines a protocol-independent
    language for the extraction, processing, and analysis of multi-dimensional gridded
    [[http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/glossary/c | coverages]] representing sensor,
    image, or statistics data. Services implementing this language provide access
    to original or derived sets of geospatial coverage information, in forms that
    are useful for client-side rendering, input into scientific models, and other
    client applications.\r\n\r\nFurther information about WPCS can be found at the
    [[http://www.ogcnetwork.net/wcps | WCPS Service]] page of the OGC Network."
