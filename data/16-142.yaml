abstract:
- content: This document describes an extension to the existing RDF Data Cube ontology
    to support specification of key metadata required to interpret spatio-temporal
    data. The RDF Data Cube defines CodedProperties, which relate to a reference system
    based on a list of terms, QB4ST provides generalized support for numeric and other
    ordered references systems, particularly Spatial Reference Systems and Temporal
    Reference Systems. Although RDF Data Cube supports AttributeProperties for metadata
    of individual observations, the requirement is to specify such metadata per property,
    rather than for each observation, and thus allow different properties to use different
    spatial or temporal reference systems. QB4ST also provides for such properties
    to be defined for a ComponentProperty, or defined at the time of referencing that
    ComponentProperty in a ComponentSpecification. QB4ST is thus aimed at improving
    the scope and consistency of dataset metadata, and hence discovery and interpretation
    of spatio-temporal data through its spatio-temporal reference system and bounding
    values.
