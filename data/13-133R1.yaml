abstract:
- content: "Publish/Subscribe 1.0 is an interface specification that supports the
    core components and concepts of the Publish/Subscribe message exchange pattern
    with OGC Web Services.  The Publish/Subscribe pattern complements the Request/Reply
    pattern historically specified by many OGC Web Services. This specification may
    be used either in concert with, or independently of, existing OGC Web Services
    to publish data of interest to subscribers.\r\n\r\nPublish/Subscribe 1.0 primarily
    addresses subscription management capabilities such as creating a subscription,
    renewing a subscription, and unsubscribing.  However, this standard also allows
    Publish/Subscribe services to advertise and describe the supported message delivery
    protocols such as SOAP messaging, ATOM, and AMQP.  Message delivery protocols
    should be considered to be independent of the Publish/Subscribe 1.0 standard.
    \ Therefore OGC Publish/Subscribe only includes metadata relating to message delivery
    protocols in sufficient detail to allow for different implementations of Publish/Subscribe
    1.0 to interoperate. \r\n\r\nThis specification defines an extension to the OGC
    Publish/Subscribe (PubSub) 1.0 Core to allow for Publish/Subscribe communications
    usingthe SOAP protocol."
