abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed-14 Engineering Report (ER) describes the results of the
    Augmented Reality (AR) work performed in the Testbed-14 CityGML and Augmented
    Reality work package which was part of the Next Generation Services thread.\r\n\r\nBy
    integrating information available from urban models within a view of the real
    world through a mobile device, this testbed activity explored the possibilities
    offered by AR in a geospatial context. The ER additionally discusses the approach
    used to bring in these urban models from various data sources. The experiments
    also covered to some extent Virtual Reality (VR) where any city can be explored
    freely from a computer display or potentially within a VR headset.\r\n\r\nA continuation
    of these experiments would have looked at a combination of Augmented and Virtual
    Reality (Mixed Reality). The portrayal of AR and three-dimensional (3D) content
    through extending a common conceptual model to style classic geospatial features
    (as explored in the Testbed-14 Portrayal work) is also touched upon. The efficient
    transmission of 3D content is also a subject of this document through the use
    of a simple 3D transmission format developed during the initiative.\r\n\r\nThis
    ER provides many insights that showcase what is now made possible by the combination
    of AR, VR and integrated urban models.\r\n\r\nThe testbed work shines light on
    the benefits of applying a common portrayal approach to AR, bridging the gap between
    AR applications and traditional Geographic Information Systems and services.\r\n\r\nThe
    ER introduces a new, simple approach and conceptual model for transmitting 3D
    geospatial content which could be the basis to define simple profiles for the
    I3S and 3D Tiles community standards. It could also inform enhancements to the
    3D Portrayal Service (3DPS) and/or next generation services (e.g., WFS 3.0) for
    delivering 3D contents in a format agnostic manner.\r\n\r\nFinally, the ER covers
    methods to bring in different types of geospatial content from various sources
    for integration into AR applications.\r\n\r\nDuring Testbed-14, the participants
    demonstrated AR experiences with geospatial datasets providing integrated views
    of urban spaces. Two clients and two services were shown to be interoperable,
    streaming AR content through a simple 3D transmission format, leveraging either
    GeoJSON or GNOSIS Map Tiles, as well as E3D 3D model specifications.\r\n\r\nThe
    feasibility of extending a classic portrayal conceptual model for AR was also
    shown. In order to serve them to the clients in the supported transmission formats,
    geospatial data sets of various types and in various formats were successfully
    imported for consumption by the services."
