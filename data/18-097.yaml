abstract:
- content: Systems that maintain and disseminate information representing and/or related
    to spatial features often lack mechanisms to describe or discover how features
    relate to each other, to other kinds of features, and to a wide variety of related
    information that may be relevant. The Environmental Linked Features Interoperability
    Experiment (ELFIE) explored Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and World Wide Web
    Consortium (W3C) standards with the goal of establishing a best practice for exposing
    cross-domain links between environmental domain and sampling features. The Interoperability
    Experiment (IE) focused on encoding relationships between cross-domain features
    and linking available observations data to sampled domain features. An approach
    that leverages the OGC service baseline, W3C data on the web best practices, and
    JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data (JSON-LD) contexts was developed and
    evaluated. Outcomes of the experiment demonstrate that broadly accepted web technologies
    for linked data can be applied using OGC services and domain data models to fill
    important gaps in existing environmental data systems' capabilities. While solutions
    were found to be capable and promising, OGC services and domain model implementations
    have limited utility for use in linked data applications in their current state
    and the universe of persistent URIs that form the foundation of a linked data
    infrastructure is still small. In addition to improvement of the standards baseline
    and publication of linked data URIs, establishing conventions for URI dereferencing
    behavior and default content given multiple options for a resource remain for
    future work.
