abstract:
- content: "This document investigates the potential for harmonisation of water data
    standards, with the goal of developing an OGC compliant standard for the exchange
    of water observation data. The work will be based on OGCâ€˜s Observations and Measurements
    abstract model [10-004r2] . The goal is to create an O&M profile for the water
    domain. Development of the OGC compliant O&M profile will begin by examining the
    content and structure of existing standards and suggesting future methodology
    for developing a harmonised model for observation data. This approach will make
    use of existing standards where possible.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this document is
    in-situ style observations (which are generally related to water quantity). Ex-situ
    measurements, such as those common to measuring water quality, will be addressed
    in future work.\r\n2 Normative"
