abstract:
- content: "The goal of the Geo4NIEM thread in Testbed 11 was to gain Intelligence
    Community\r\n(IC) concurrence of the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)
    Version 3.0\r\narchitecture through the development, implementations, test, and
    robust demonstration\r\nmaking use of IC specifications, Geography Markup Language
    (GML), and NIEM in a\r\nsimulated “real-world” scenario. The demonstration scenario
    begins with NIEMconformant\r\nInformation Exchange Packages (IEPs) containing
    operational data and IC\r\nsecurity tags from the Information Security Marking
    (ISM) and Need-To-Know (NTK)\r\naccess control metadata, and the Trusted Data
    Format (TDF) for binding assertion\r\nmetadata with data resource(s). Those instance
    documents are deployed on Open\r\nGeospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Services to
    be used by client applications. Access\r\ncontrol is based on attributes of the
    end-user and the instance data.\r\nRecommendations to update these information
    exchanges were provided to reflect NIEM\r\n3.0 architecture and security tags
    in a ‘NIEM/IC Data Encoding’. The assessment\r\nexercised this data encoding in
    OGC Web Feature Services (WFS) and Policy\r\nEnforcement Points (PEP) accessed
    by multiple client applications. Results from this task\r\nprovided a preliminary
    architecture that was tested and demonstrated in Testbed 11, and\r\nsummarized
    in other OGC Testbed 11 Engineering Reports."
