abstract:
- content: 'This Motion Imagery Discovery and Retrieval Engineering Report (ER) documents
    the metadata used to tag geolocation of Motion Imagery (MI) for discovery, retrieval
    and linkage with other data sources over the same location, especially the metadata
    information required to geometrically co-register multiple motion images at pixel
    level so that data recorded at different times (e.g., different days) and/or by
    different providers for common or overlapped FOVs can be compared and pixel level
    changes among the different images can be accurately detected and delineated.  This
    ER reflects one of the achievements during the OWS 7 Sensor Fusion Enablement
    (SFE) thread, which builds on the OGC Sensor Web Enablement framework that has
    achieved a degree of maturity through previous OWS interoperability initiatives
    and deployments worldwide. '
