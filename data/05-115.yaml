abstract:
- content: "A GeoVideo Web Service (GVS) is a web service that facilitates the viewing
    of live and/or archived feeds from video cameras. The feeds may be composed of:\r\n-
    A video stream\r\n- Textual data in a caption stream (e.g. GPS data, camera states
    and characteristics, custom XML data, such as SensorMLTML)\r\n- A combination
    of a video stream and associated textual data\r\nThe video streams of the feed
    may be viewed in the Windows Media Player. The textual data is extracted through
    scripting events that are generated as the caption stream is processed and displayed
    by the Windows Media Player."
