abstract:
- content: This document defines a messaging framework to conduct communications between
    the OGC web services. It is independent of any transport protocol and any messaging
    encoding. By using the framework, the service designer could focus only on the
    message definitions and messaging flows for every action supported by the service,
    without worry on the messaging transport and delivery. The framework should considerably
    simplify the implementations of the OGC web services and should enable service
    chaining.
