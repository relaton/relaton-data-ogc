abstract:
- content: "The OGC netCDF encoding supports electronic encoding of geospatial data,
    that is, digital geospatial information representing space and time-varying phenomena.\r\nThis
    standard specifies the CF-netCDF data model extension. \r\nThis standard specifies
    the CF-netCDF data model mapping onto the ISO 19123 coverage schema. \r\nThis
    standard deals with multi-dimensional gridded data and multi-dimensional multi-point
    data.\r\nIn particular, this extension standard encoding profile is limited to
    multi-point, and regular and warped grids; however, irregular grids are important
    in the CF-netCDF community and work is underway to expand the CF-netCDF to encompass
    other coverages types, including irregular gridded datasets.\r\n"
