abstract:
- content: "Hierarchical Data Format Version 5 (HDF5®) is a data model, a programming
    interface, and a storage model for keeping and managing data. It supports an unlimited
    variety of data types, and is designed to be flexible and efficient for large
    and complex data. HDF5 is extensible via customizing data types, allowing communities
    and their applications to evolve in the use of HDF5.\r\n\r\nThis document describes
    the HDF5 data model as an encoding standard particularly suitable to scientific
    and engineering geospatial applications that employ multidimensional numeric arrays
    to describe temporally and spatially varying phenomena. The data model is simple
    yet versatile, capable of supporting complex data relationships and dependencies
    through its grouping and linking mechanisms. It is also self-describing by accommodating
    user-defined metadata."
