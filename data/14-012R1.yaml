abstract:
- content: "This OGC® Best Practices document specifies the interfaces, bindings,
    requirements and conformance classes that enable complete workflows for the tasking
    of sensor planning services for Earth Observation (EO) satellites. In fact it
    provides the interfaces for supporting the following EO sensor planning scenarios:\r\n•\tPlanning
    future acquisitions with feasibility study,\r\n•\tDirect planning of future acquisitions,\r\n•\tReservation
    of planning for future acquisitions.\r\nThis specification includes a comprehensive
    list of sensor options and tasking options derived from the parent specification
    OGC 10-135 [NR22] which gathered inputs from several Satellite Agencies and Operators:\r\n•\tESA\r\n•\tEUMETSAT\r\n•\tCNES\r\n•\tDLR\r\n•\tCSA\r\n•\tAirbus
    Defence & Space\r\nThis document is based on the standard:\r\nOGC 10-135, Sensor
    Planning Service Interface Standard 2.0 Earth Observation \r\nSatellite Tasking
    Extension, version 2.0. 2011.\r\n\r\nwhich was initially produced during the ESA
    HMA (Heterogeneous Missions Accessibility) initiative [OR1] and related projects.\r\nWith
    respect to the parent specification this Best Practice document proposes the following
    changes:\r\n•\tReplaces SOAP with REST for service encoding. This affects not
    only the way the service is implemented but also the way the standard is presented
    and described. In fact, basing the standard on REST implies that the service has
    to be described in terms of resources and methods applied on them whilst in SOAP
    services, the description is focusing on operations and in fact the OGC 10-135[NR22]
    is structured in Web Service operations.\r\n•\tUsage of OpenSearch Description
    Documents as an alternate method for describing sensors and tasking Options (§7.3.2).
    This specification uses the sensors and tasking options model already described
    in the OGC 10-135 [NR22] standard but defines an additional method for describing
    sensors and tasking options within OpenSearch Description Documents based on the
    OGC 13-039 [NR23]. Actually this part of the specification refers to the OpenSearch
    Extension for Earth Observation Satellite Tasking.\r\n&#8195;\r\n"
