abstract:
- content: "This OGCTM document describes best practices for building and maintaining
    inter-related\r\ndomain models, which have dependencies upon multiple systems.
    It describes how to\r\nbuild interoperable, maintainable domain models, the challenges
    and pitfalls faced in\r\nbuilding these models, the techniques and patterns that
    should be applied, and specific\r\ntools that can be used. The theory of domain
    modelling is addressed, followed by\r\npractical step-by-step instructions on
    how to use of the tools. Examples are provided from\r\nAeronautical Information
    Exchange Model (AIXM) and Farm Markup Language\r\n(FarmML) as they were refined
    in the OGC’s OWS-8 testbed."
