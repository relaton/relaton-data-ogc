abstract:
- content: A Web 3D Service (W3DS) is a portrayal service for three-dimensional geodata,
    such as landscape models, city models, textured building models, vegetation objects,
    and street furniture. Geodata is delivered as scenes that are comprised of display
    elements, optimized for efficient real time rendering at high frame rates.
