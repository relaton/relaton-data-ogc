abstract:
- content: "The OGC API – Images and Changeset draft specification addresses the use
    case of an OGC API tile server that serves image tiles and a client that portrays
    the result as a set of images. The tile server uses a set of images (e.g. a set
    of remote sensing satellite scenes or a set of drone pictures) in the backend
    and they are also accessible by an API - Images. The source images can be updated
    and therefore the tile server also needs to be able to deliver only the tiles
    that have changed. The draft specification is divided into two independent parts
    that can be used in broader scenarios:\r\n\r\nThe OGC API – Images: Enables managing
    (retrieving, creating and updating) sets of images that are georeferenced. The
    images does not follow any tile scheme, and can partiallyor totally overlap. The
    API enables a mosaicking use case (where the imagery is combined in a single bigger
    “picture”) but could also serve a use case in which a moving camera is taking
    pictures at locations along a route and then stores the images as a single collection.\r\n\r\nThe
    Changeset filter: Enables filtering a request to a data service in a way that
    only recent changes are delivered. It can be applied to OGC API that provide access
    to data and in particular to the OGC API tiles."
