abstract:
- content: "The industries dedicated to the Architecture, Engineering, Construction,
    and Operation of Infrastructure Assets (AECO) have been adopting state of the
    art advancements in information technologies, including Building Information Modeling
    (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). These efforts
    have been leading these industries to embrace Digital Twin (DT) applications and
    processes in order to enhance Business Intelligence, Decision Support, and Situational
    Awareness. The concretion of these developments heavily rely on the overall quality,
    alignment, and discoverability of data in a DT. Semantical standardization of
    data is an important part of those requirements, which enables outcomes such as
    automated validation, interoperability, and simulations. This discussion paper
    focuses on a piece of information that is common to most of those goals: semantical
    machine-understanding of materials captured in a DT for AECO.\r\n\r\nThis paper
    presents a brief overview of the state of the modeling of materials in a sample
    of existing standards — IFC and 3D Tiles — and software vendor applications — Base
    Infrastructure Schemas (BIS), an Open Source effort by Bentley Systems, and Granta
    MI, a commercial Materials Data Management (MDM) system by Ansys — relevant for
    AECO industries. This is done in light of the needs for machine-understanding
    of materials in a DT for AECO."
