abstract:
- content: "The OpenGIS® Catalogue Services Interface Standard (CAT) supports the
    ability to publish and search collections of descriptive information (metadata)
    about geospatial data, services and related resources. Providers of resources
    use catalogues to register metadata that conform to the provider's choice of an
    information model; such models include descriptions of spatial references and
    thematic information. Client applications can then search for geospatial data
    and services in very efficient ways.  \r\nSee also the OGC Catalogue 2.0 Accessibility

    CSW ebRIM Modelling Guidelines Interoperability Program Report (IPR) [www.opengeospatial.org/standards/dp]
    and the OpenGIS® Catalogue Service Interface Standard 2.0.1 - FGDC CSDGM Application
