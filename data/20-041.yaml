abstract:
- content: "The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) defines Analysis
    Ready Data (ARD) for Land (CARD4L) as satellite data that have been processed
    to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate
    analysis with a minimum of additional user effort and interoperability both through
    time and with other datasets.\r\n\r\nThis OGC Testbed 16 Engineering Report (ER)
    generalizes the ARD concept and studies its implications for the OGC Standards
    baseline. In particular, the ER analyses how modern federated data processing
    architectures applying data cubes and Docker packages can take advantage of the
    existence of ARD. Architectures for ARD should minimize data transmission and
    allow and favor code transmission and remote execution. This ER also considers
    a workflow in which new processes are triggered as soon as new data becomes available.
    This is part of the event driven discussion."
