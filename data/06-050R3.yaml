abstract:
- content: GeoRSS is simple proposal for geo-enabling, or tagging, really simple syndication
    (RSS) feeds with location information. GeoRSS proposes a standardized way in which
    location is encoded with enough simplicity and descriptive power to satisfy most
    needs to describe the location of Web content. GeoRSS may not work for every use,
    but it should serve as an easy-to-use geotagging encoding that is brief and simple
    with useful defaults but extensible and upwardly-compatible with more sophisticated
    encoding standards such as the OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) GML (Geography
    Markup Language).
