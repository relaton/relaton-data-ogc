abstract:
- content: Mobile location based service applications and users have an increasing
    need for access to geospatial data from any place in the world, including locations
    with limited or intermittent connectivity to communications networks. Maintaining
    consistency between copies of the same data held by different mobile devices can
    be a significant challenge when connectivity is limited or intermittent. This
    OGC Engineering Report describes the work carried out in OGC Testbed-11  in relation
    to the creation and synchronization of SQLite databases that conform to the OGC
    GeoPackage standard . This Engineering Report describes an approach for the use
    of various standards to achieve such synchronization. The document also presents
    the results and lessons learnt from the experimentation conducted in the Testbed.
