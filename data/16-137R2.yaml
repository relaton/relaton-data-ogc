abstract:
- content: "This document describes how the OGC PubSub standard can be used as a mechanism
    to automatically notify analysts of data availability for CSW and other OGC Web
    Services (e.g. WFS, WCS). In particular, this document proposes the following:\r\n\r\nSpecific
    PubSub 1.0 extensions for CSW 2.0.2 and 3.0, leveraging on standard functionalities,
    data models, and semantics to enable sending notifications based on user-specified
    area of interest and/or keywords;\r\n\r\nA general, basic mechanism for enabling
    PubSub for the generic OGC Web Service over the existing request/reply OWSâ€™s,
    i.e. usual requests as filters, usual responses as appropriate updates/data pushes,
    existing semantics and syntax expressiveness.\r\n\r\nThis document is the result
    of activity performed within the Large-Scale Analytics (LSA) Thread of the OGC
    Testbed 12 Interoperability initiative, being identified as document deliverable
    A074 PubSub / Catalog Engineering Report. This document also captures lessons
    learnt from the implementation of component deliverable A016 CSW 2.0.2 with PubSub
    Core Support Server."
