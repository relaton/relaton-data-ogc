abstract:
- content: "The OWS-8 Cross Community Interoperability (CCI) thread built on progress
    made in the recent OWS-7 initiative to cover key technology areas that could not
    be addressed within the scope of that initiative. The OWS-8 CCI thread aimed to
    increase interoperability within communities sharing geospatial data, including
    advancing of interoperability among heterogeneous data models, advancing strategies
    to share styles to provide a more common and automated use of symbology, improvement
    of KML, and advancing schema automation allowing communities to better share their
    information artefacts. This OGC engineering report aims to present findings from
    CCI thread activities towards advancement of semantic mediation involving data
    retrieved from heterogeneous data models that are available through web services
    conformant to OGC standards. \r\nThe engineering report will briefly introduce
    relevant details of the semantic web and mediation. The document will make recommendations
    on establishing a semantic mediation architecture that uses OGC web services and
    emerging practice from the semantic web community. Based on the scenario adopted
    by the CCI thread, the document will also discuss the pros and cons of adopting
    relevant standards. The engineering report will offer recommendations on how specific
    OGC standards may be adopted or modified in order to support semantic mediation.\r\n"
