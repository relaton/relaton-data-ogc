abstract:
- content: "AIXM is a GML Application Schema described in UML using the relevant ISO
    / OGC standards from the 19100 series. The Digital NOTAM Events Specification
    (DNES) is an extension of AIXM that can describe notices to airmen using the AIXM
    standard. \r\nThis document has been produced in conjunction with the Domain Modelling
    Cookbook - a practical guide to domain modelling following a series of best practices
    developed by the CSIRO and other OGC members.\r\nWhere possible, documentation
    of the refactor effort for Digital NOTAM to be compatible with these practices
    is incorporated into the domain modelling cookbook. "
