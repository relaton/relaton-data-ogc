abstract:
- content: "The design of core OGC Web Services (OWS) does not entertain the possibility
    of network unavailability, internet unavailability, or disconnected clients and
    datastores. Deployments of these services, and the clients that consume them,
    often happen in networking environments that have limited bandwidth, sporadic
    connectivity and no connection to the internet. This Engineering Report (ER) focuses
    on situations of Denied, Degraded, Intermittent, or Limited Bandwidth (DDIL).
    Due to these DDIL networking limitations, OWS services and clients may not be
    capable of effective data exchange and interpretation due to a reliance on external
    resources and always-on networks.\r\n\r\nThis ER concerns the behavior of common
    OWS services when used in DDIL environments. The ER documents proposed practices/considerations
    for implementation of these services to support these environments. The ER also
    describes software modules or extensions that might mitigate the effects of these
    environments on both clients and services.\r\n\r\nThis ER intends to guide client
    and service implementation, as well as deployment strategies for these challenging
    environments.\r\n\r\n"
