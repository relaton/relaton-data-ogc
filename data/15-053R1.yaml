abstract:
- content: In the OGC Testbed 11, the Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI) thread
    had a key objective of building on the work accomplished in the OGC 8, 9 and 10
    Testbeds. The goal of the CCI threads is to increase interoperability between
    communities sharing geospatial data. This thread made advances in semantic mediation
    approaches for data discovery, access and use of heterogeneous data models and
    heterogeneous metadata models. This particular Engineering Report (ER) is part
    of the OGC efforts to advance the OGC Architecture with the adoption of REST interfaces
    and more encodings such as JSON.
