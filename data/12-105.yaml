abstract:
- content: This OGC Engineering Report describes the results of the OWS-9 IP on OWS
    Context 1.0. OWS Context is a draft OGC candidate standard. The OWS Context activity
    tested and evaluated the relative benefits of different encoding methods prior
    to finalization of the candidate standard. OWS Context has been proposed with
    an Atom encoding, a JSON encoding and an HTML5 encoding. The encoding requirement
    seeks to understand the level of mass-market acceptance of these different encoding
    options and their ability to support mash-ups. Each encoding should be evaluated,
    including examples and recommendations to move forward. Recommendations should
    enable the OWS Context capability for OGC services while remaining cognizant of
    implementations using mass-market technologies.
