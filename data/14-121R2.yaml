abstract:
- content: "This OGC Web Query Service (WQS) defines a service interface for retrieving
    any kind of subset of information provided by the server addressed. WQS is com¬pletely
    agnostic of any semantics and, therefore, not bound to any predefined structures,
    such as coordinates, fea-tures, coverages, or metadata. This makes WQS particularly
    suitable for retrieval from heter-ogeneous data offerings combining features,
    coverages, and catalog information in some ap-plication-defined way. A second
    use case is selective retrieval from a Capabilities document to avoid downloading
    large such documents and performing extraction on client side.\r\nTo this end,
    the Query request type is defined which, based on an XPath expression as input,
    extracts the matching information from the service’s offering and returns it (currently:
    as an XML document).\r\n"
