abstract:
- content: This document seeks to define the Best Practices for integrating Common
    Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Sensor Interface (CCSI)
    compliant and potentially other CBRN-based sensors into an OGC Sensor Web Enablement
    (SWE)-based environment.  The document focuses on the practical application of
    SWE services and encodings for describing and interacting with CCSI sensors and
    data and draws heavily from and expands upon work performed in the OGC Web Services
    Phase 6 (OWS-6) testbed to define methodologies for integrating CCSI sensors into
    a SWE-based environment both now, by building upon the OWS-6 work, and in the
    future, by defining CCSI profiles of the SWE specifications.
