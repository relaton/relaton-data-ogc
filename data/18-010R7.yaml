abstract:
- content: "This Standard defines the structure and content of well-known text strings
    describing coordinate reference systems (CRSs) and coordinate operations between
    coordinate reference systems. It does not prescribe how implementations should
    read or write these strings.\r\n\r\nThis Standard provides an updated version
    of WKT representation of coordinate reference systems that follows the provisions
    of ISO 19111:2019. It extends the WKT in OGC document 12-063r5 (ISO 19162) which
    was based on ISO 19111:2007 and ISO 19111-2:2009. That version consolidated several
    disparate versions of earlier WKT (so-called WKT1) and added the description of
    coordinate operations.\r\n\r\nThis jointly developed draft has been submitted
    by ISO TC211 for circulation as a Draft International Standard (DIS). This version
    incorporates comments made during the ISO TC211 New Work Item Proposal acceptance
    ballot."
