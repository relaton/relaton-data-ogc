abstract:
- content: "The OGC Testbed-16 Data Centric Security Engineering Report (ER) continues
    the evaluation of a data-centric security (DCS) approach in a geospatial environment.
    In order to fully explore the potential of the DCS concept, this ER first specifies
    two advanced use case scenarios: Data Streaming and Offline Authorization for
    querying and consuming protected geospatial content. The ER then specifies the
    communication with a new architectural component called the Key Management Server
    (KMS) via an Application Programming Interface (API) created for this Testbed.
    The API was invoked to register keys used to encrypt data-centric protected content.
    Then clients called the same API to obtain those keys to perform the data verification/decryption.\r\n\r\n"
