abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report (ER) describes best practices and results gathered
    through the work performed in the Exploitation Platforms Earth Observation Clouds
    (EOC) Thread of OGC Testbed-14 concerning the Application Deployment and Execution
    Service (ADES) and the Execution Management Service (EMS). Both the ADES and EMS
    were identified by the European Space Agency (ESA), beforehand, as essential elements
    of a Thematic Exploitation Platform (TEP).\r\n\r\nIn the context of a generic
    Earth Observation Exploitation Platform ecosystem, populated by TEPs and Mission
    Exploitation Platforms (MEPs), which make use of cloud computing resources for
    Earth Observation data processing, ESA has established two fundamental building
    blocks within a TEP, with different functions, the ADES and the EMS. Users interact
    with a TEP using a Web Client, and the TEP contains a EMS and a ADES. The EMS
    includes most of the control logic, required for deploying and executing applications
    in different MEPs and TEPs, the chaining thereof, and the overall coherence of
    the execution chain (e.g. gathering all outputs and enabling their presentation
    to the user by a client sensibly). The ADES instead is responsible for the single
    application deployment and execution on a specific platform. Therefore, it is
    expected that there are ADES instances both in a TEP and in the individual MEPs.\r\n\r\nThe
    Testbed-14 Participants have experimented with different options for what concerns
    the functionality allocated to each of the two components, the information required
    by each of them and the interface requirements between them in order to produce
    a consistent chain, compliant with ESAâ€™s objectives (as the Sponsor). This report
    describes these experiments, providing their results and suggesting best practices
    on how the two services should be engineered in the Exploitation Platform context.\r\n\r\nThe
    OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) 2.0 standard is of particular relevance given
    that it is well-established in the OGC Web Service context, specifically that
    concerning processing, its interoperability value has been clearly demonstrated,
    and it therefore provides a useful mechanism for standardizing interfaces between
    components of heterogeneous provenance and implementation."
