abstract:
- content: "This report describes the methods, results, issues and recommendations
    generated by the\r\nGroundwater Interoperability Experiment (GWIE). As an activity
    of the OGC Hydrology\r\nDomain Working Group (HDWG), the GWIE is designed to:
    (1) test the use of\r\nWaterML2 with the SOS interface, and Groundwater ML (GWML)
    with the WFS\r\ninterface, (2) test compatibility with software clients, and (3)
    facilitate sharing of massive\r\nvolumes of sensor-based water level observations
    and related water well features across\r\nthe Canada and United States border. "
