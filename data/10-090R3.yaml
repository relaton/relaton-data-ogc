abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the network Common Data Form (netCDF) core standard
    and extension mechanisms. The OGC netCDF encoding supports electronic encoding
    of geospatial data, specifically digital geospatial information representing space
    and time-varying phenomena.\r\nNetCDF is a data model for array-oriented scientific
    data. A freely distributed collection of access libraries implementing support
    for that data model, and a machine-independent format are available. Together,
    the interfaces, libraries, and format support the crea-tion, access, and sharing
    of multi-dimensional scientific data.\r\n"
