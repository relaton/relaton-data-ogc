abstract:
- content: "OGC API Standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable
    Web APIs in a consistent way. The OpenAPI specification is used to define the
    API building blocks.\r\n\r\nOGC API - Features provides API building blocks to
    create, modify and query features on the Web. OGC API - Features is comprised
    of multiple parts. Each part is a separate standard.\r\n\r\nA fundamental operation
    performed on a collection of features is that of filtering in order to obtain
    a subset of the data which contains feature instances that satisfy some filtering
    criteria. Part three of the OGC API - Features Standard defines query parameters
    (filter, filter-lang, filter-crs) to specify filter criteria in a request to an
    API and the Queryables resource that declares the properties of data in a collection
    that can be used in filter expressions."
