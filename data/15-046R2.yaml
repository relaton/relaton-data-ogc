abstract:
- content: 'This OGC Engineering Report describes the high-resolution flood information
    scenario carried out under the Urban Climate Resilience Thread of the Testbed
    11 Initiative. The scenario was developed for two areas of interest: the San Francisco
    Bay Area and in Mozambique. The scenarios for these two locations demonstrate
    the interoperation and capabilities of open geospatial standards in supporting
    data and processing services. The prototype High Resolution Flood Information
    System addresses access and control of simulation models and high-resolution data
    in an open, worldwide, collaborative Web environment. The scenarios were designed
    to help testbed participants examine the feasibility and capability of using existing
    OGC geospatial Web Service standards in supporting the on-demand, dynamic serving
    of flood information from models with forecasting capacity. Change requests to
    OGC standards have also been identified through the Testbed activity.'
