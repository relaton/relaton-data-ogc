abstract:
- content: The Semantic Web seeks to make the meaning as accessible as the material,
    by enabling connections - which are both logical and (machine) actionable - between
    concepts which a user presently understands and those which may be new and foreign.
    The Geospatial Semantic Web extends this capability to both content and concepts
    that are specifically spatial, temporal, and geographic in nature, giving both
    people and machines true access to a wider range of knowledge.
