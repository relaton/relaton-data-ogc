abstract:
- content: "The OGC Testbed 19 initiative explored six tasks including this task focused
    on Machine Learning: Transfer Learning for Geospatial Applications. \r\n\r\nThis
    OGC Testbed 19 Engineering Report (ER) documents work to develop the foundation
    for future standardization of Machine Learning models for transfer learning within
    geospatial, especially Earth Observation, applications. The ER reviews the findings
    of transfer learning experiments and makes recommendations about the next steps
    in terms of both the experiments conducted and broader implications for OGC."
