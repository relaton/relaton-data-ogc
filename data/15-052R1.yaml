abstract:
- content: REST architectural principles are associated with optimal functioning of
    the Web but their manifestation in geospatial Web services standards is not straightforward.
    This OGC Engineering Report (ER) examines their use both in existing OGC Services
    standards and in new or revised service standard proposals, some of which were
    implemented during OGC Testbed 11. The ER then defines possible uniform practices
    for developing bindings or interaction styles for OGC Web services that appropriately
    leverage REST principles.
