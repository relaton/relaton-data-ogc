abstract:
- content: This Engineering Report describes how developments of the Community Sensor
    Model Working Group (CSMW) can be harmonized with the latest SWE specifications
    and developments in order to support streaming of LiDAR data with SWE technologies.
    The report will therefore provide an overview on both initiatives and then describe
    different options how to integrate LiDAR data streams and SWE technologies. In
    particular, the ER will consider the results of the activities SOS Compression
    (LiDAR) Server (A012) and LiDAR Streaming Client (A010) and infer recommendations
    for future developments.
