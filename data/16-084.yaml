abstract:
- content: 'Indoor location technologies are enjoying and increasing market success.
    Technologies in the market have achieved maturity and have become a key driver
    for innovation and business activities in several value added scenarios, e.g.
    e-government services, eHealth, personal mobility, logistics, mobility, facility
    management, retail, to name but a few. This paper collects the results of a survey
    on the benefits of indoor location, which was jointly prepared and launched by
    OGC â€“ the Open Geospatial Consortium, InLocation Alliance and i-locate project
    at the beginning of 2016. Overall, 153 survey responses were received from 33
    countries.   Responses were categorized in two areas: Client Organizations and
    Technology suppliers. The goal of the initiative was to acquire a broad view of
    the requirements and use cases emerging from the wider industrial and user community,
    beyond the memberships of the various organizations, in order to capture trends,
    challenges and opportunities, as well as trends and barriers to widespread use
    of indoor location technologies. This paper does not represent a view of the membership
    involved in the different organizations; instead, it provides the opportunity
    to capture recommendations of relevance for the industrial and standardization
    community these organizations represent. '
