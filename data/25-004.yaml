abstract:
- content: "The STAC specifications define related JSON object types connected by
    link relations to support a HATEOAS-style traversable interface and a RESTful
    API providing additional browse and search interfaces. Typically, several STAC
    specifications are composed together to create an implementation. The Item, Catalog,
    and Collection specifications define a minimal core of the most frequently used
    JSON object types. Because of the hierarchical structure between these objects,
    a STAC catalog can be implemented in a completely ‘static’ manner as a group of
    hyperlinked Catalog, Collection, and Item URLs, enabling data publishers to expose
    their data as a browsable set of files. If more complex query abilities are desired,
    such as spatial or temporal predicates, the STAC API specification can be implemented
    as a web service interface to query over a group of STAC objects, usually held
    in a database.\r\n\r\nTo the greatest extent possible, STAC uses and extends existing
    specifications. The most important object in STAC is an Item, which is simply
    a GeoJSON Feature with a well-defined set of additional attributes (“foreign members”).
    The STAC API extends the OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core with additional web
    service endpoints and object attributes."
