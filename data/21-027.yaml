abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 17 Engineering Report (ER) documents the results and
    recommendations of the Geo Data Cube API task. The ER defines a draft specification
    for an interoperable Geo Data Cube (GDC) API leveraging OGC API building blocks,
    details implementation of the draft API, and explores various aspects including
    data retrieval and discovery, cloud computing and Machine Learning. Implementations
    of the draft GDC API are demonstrated with use cases including the integration
    of terrestrial and marine elevation data and forestry information for Canadian
    wetlands.\r\n\r\n"
