abstract:
- content: The OGC Interoperable Simulation and Gaming Sprint advanced the use of
    relevant OGC and Khronos standards in the modeling and simulation community through
    practical exercise and testing of the GeoVolumes API draft specification produced
    by the 3D Data Container and Tiles API Pilot. Of particular interest was the handling
    and integration of glTF models coming from multiple sources, but the sprint also
    examined the specificationâ€™s implementability, consistency, completeness, and
    maturity.
