abstract:
- content: 'The OpenGIS® Sensor Planning Service Interface Standard (SPS) defines
    interfaces for queries that provide information about the capabilities of a sensor
    and how to task the sensor. The standard is designed to support queries that have
    the following purposes: to determine the feasibility of a sensor planning request;
    to submit and reserve/commit such a request; to inquire about the status of such
    a request; to update or cancel such a request; and to request information about
    other OGC Web services that provide access to the data collected by the requested
    task. This is one of the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) [http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/markets-technologies/swe]
    suite of standards.'
