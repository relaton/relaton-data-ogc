abstract:
- content: This International Standard defines a conceptual schema for the spatial
    characteristics of coverages. Coverages support mapping from a spatial, temporal
    or spatiotemporal domain to feature attribute values where feature attribute types
    are common to all geographic positions within the domain. A coverage domain consists
    of a collection of direct positions in a coordinate space that may be defined
    in terms of up to three spatial dimensions as well as a temporal dimension.
