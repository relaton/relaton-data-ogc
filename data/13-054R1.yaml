abstract:
- content: "Geospatial information technologies are increasingly a foundation for
    supporting Information Sharing Environment (ISE), homeland security (HLS), homeland
    defense (HLD), law enforcement (LE), emergency management (EM) and public safety
    missions in the US.  The inability to transport, deliver and exchange geospatial
    information for critical geospatial assets increases the risk to the nation.\r\nMany
    ISE HLS/HDS/LE mission partners have developed stand-alone geospatial information
    systems (GIS) or Common Operating Picture (COP) applications to support their
    stakeholder communities during incidents and for daily operational support. While
    different missions, these GIS/COP capabilities rely upon much of the same data
    or generate specific data during an event.  The data are often stove-piped and
    not exposed to a broader community that could benefit from these data, resulting
    in duplication and delayed or incorrect decisions. While mission partners do not
    need to use the same GIS/COP tools, they could benefit from shared access to the
    common operating data and services used within these systems if they were exposed
    and exchanged using open standards.\r\nUnder the auspices of the Program Manager
    for the Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE), an identified government-wide
    information sharing shortfall will be resolved by funding work to enhance the
    National Information Exchange Model (NIEM). The focus of this work is to further
    enhance the frameworkâ€™s geospatial exchange capability in light of guidelines
    and standards issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) so as to significantly
    improve inter-government information sharing.\r\n"
