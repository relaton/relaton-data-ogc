abstract:
- content: 'This OGC Discussion Paper (DP) provides a proposal for a temporality extension
    for the WFS 2.0 and FES 2.0 standard. It is based on the work of and experiences
    made in several OWS test beds, in particular OWS-7 and OWS-8, Aviation threads
    and discussions at the 2011 OGC TC meeting in Brussels, Belgium. This DP partially
    replaces and advances the document OWS-8 Aviation: Guidance for Retrieving AIXM
    5.1 data via an OGC WFS 2.0 [4].'
