abstract:
- content: "The LAS file is intended to contain LIDAR (or other) point cloud data
    records. The data will\r\ngenerally be put into this format from software (e.g.
    provided by LIDAR hardware vendors) which\r\ncombines GPS, IMU, and laser pulse
    range data to produce X, Y, and Z point data. The intention\r\nof the data format
    is to provide an open format that allows different LIDAR hardware and software\r\ntools
    to output data in a common format.\r\nThis document reflects the fourth revision
    of the LAS format specification since its initial version\r\n1.0 release."
