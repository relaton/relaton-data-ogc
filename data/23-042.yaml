abstract:
- content: "Testbed-18 explored the potential use of OGC Standards for non-terrestrial
    applications and was scoped as a paper study. Validation of the Testbed-18 recommendations
    has been left for Testbed-19. This OGC Engineering Report (ER) documents recommended
    changes to OGC Standards and the implementation experience to justify those changes.\r\n\r\nThe
    use of OGC Standards include geospatial applications for non-Earth planets as
    well as interplanetary spatiotemporal applications. Two Standards emerged as key:
    ISO 19111 (OGC Abstract Specification 2: Referencing by coordinates) and OGC 21-056r11
    (OGC GeoPose 1.0 Data Exchange Standard). Extensions to ISO 19111 were identified
    which would support the representation of non-terrestrial planetary spatial reference
    systems as well as interplanetary spatiotemporal reference systems.\r\n\r\nThe
    GeoPose Standard (GeoPose) was explored as a mechanism to integrate the large
    number of reference systems and transformations needed to model the geometry of
    interplanetary spacetime.\r\n\r\nIn the context of the Double Asteroid Redirection
    Test (DART) scenario, positions and orientations in different coordinate reference
    systems and associated attributes such as velocities of non-terrestrial objects
    were encoded using two different approaches: as sequences of extended GeoPoses,
    and as OGC Moving Features JSON (MF-JSON). These encoded data were then used as
    the basis for a 3D visualization demonstration.\r\n\r\nThis work is not intended
    to replace the existing standards already used in astronomy such as the World
    Coordinate System (WCS). The recommendations provided in this ER are rather intended
    to improve interoperability by specifying how to export a subset of a WCS description
    as OGC/ISO data structures for consumption by GIS software or other geospatial
    technology applications.\r\n\r\nTestbed-18 also investigated how GeoPose could
    be integrated with mobile location-aware devices such as smartphones. Engineering
    Report OGC 22-016r3 (Testbed-18: Moving Features) concluded that GeoPose could
    enrich data with location and orientation information synchronized to video and
    other sensors and identified two suitable road network use cases for study using
    WebVMT in Testbed-19."
