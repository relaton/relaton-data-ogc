abstract:
- content: The goal of this OGC Routing Pilot Engineering Report (ER) is to document
    the proof of concept of an Application Programming Interface (API) conforming
    to a profile of the draft OGC API - Processes specification that allows implementation
    of vector routing across one or more routing engines. The components implemented
    in the OGC Open Routing API Pilot 2019 included two clients, interfacing with
    three implementations of the draft OGC API - Processes specification that in turn
    communicated with three routing engines. This work resulted in the definition
    of a proposed common interface and data exchange model supported by all components
    for requesting, generating and returning routes.
