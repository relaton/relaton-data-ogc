abstract:
- content: This OGC document reports on an Interoperability Experiment (IE) aimed
    at creating the necessary semantic and technical framework for water quality data
    exchange. Water quality is one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs)  and is one of the main challenges that societies will face during the
    21st century, threatening human health, limiting food production, reducing ecosystem
    functions, and hindering economic growth.
