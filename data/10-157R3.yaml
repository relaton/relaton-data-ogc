abstract:
- content: "This OGC Implementation Standard defines a profile of Observations and
    Measurements (ISO 19156) for describing Earth Observation products (EO products).\r\nAlthough
    this standard has been developed in the context of the Heterogeneous Mission Accessibility
    (HMA) project initiated by European Space Agency (ESA), the content is generic
    to Earth Observation product description. The metadata model described in this
    document is structured to follow the different types of products (Optical, Radar,
    …) which are not HMA specific.\r\n"
