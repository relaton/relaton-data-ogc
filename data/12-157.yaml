abstract:
- content: This engineering report proposes a profile for WMTS that limits the flexibility
    or the standard and mimics what some other tile initiatives are doing. It also
    proposes some improvements in WMTS to accommodate the need for requesting several
    tiles of a region at different scales that has been identified by the GeoPackage
    team. These recommendations help to better harmonize OSGeo tile standards and
    mass-market technologies.
