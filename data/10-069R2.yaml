abstract:
- content: This candidate standard describes a service that allows data collectors
    to propose changes to be made to a data provider's features.  A change proposal
    can be made to create new data or to modify/delete existing data. Proposed changes
    are reviewed (either manually or automatically) an are either accepted or rejected.  Accepted
    changes are applied to the feature(s).  The service also maintains a log of all
    changes applied to each feature that can be used for replication.
