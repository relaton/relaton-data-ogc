- content: The Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Owner Operator, Phase 1 (AECOO-1)
    Testbed developed and implemented methods to streamline communications between
    parties in the conceptual design phase to get an early understanding of the tradeoffs
    between construction cost and energy efficiency. To that end, the project developed
    the interoperability components required for these analyses in collaborative team
    settings. These were Information Delivery Manuals (IDMs) for quantity takeoffs
    and energy analysis business processes, and used these to define Model View Definitions
    (MVDs)â€”standards-based subsets of Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs). AECOO-1
    was conducted in response the felt need that overall productivity loss and fragmentation
    in the capital facilities development industries is no longer tolerable. All stakeholders
    need to practice the best way they know, and practice profitably; software interoperability
    problems must not hold them back. Non-interoperable software and data is cause
    for loss of competition across the market.
