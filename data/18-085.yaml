abstract:
- content: This Engineering Report (ER) presents the results of the D146 Business
    Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) Engine work item and provides a study covering
    technologies including Docker, Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry for Developer Operations
    (DevOps) processes and deployment orchestration. The document also provides the
    beginning of a best practices effort to assist implementers wishing to orchestrate
    OGC services using BPMN workflow engines. As with previous investigations into
    workflow engines, the implementation described within utilizes a helper class,
    which is a bespoke implementation of some of the best practices. Work in future
    testbeds on workflows should include a compelling use case to demonstrate the
    power of service orchestration.
