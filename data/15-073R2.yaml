abstract:
- content: "This OGC Engineering Report (ER) describes work done in OGC Testbed 11
    to test\r\nGMLJP2 in terms of defining a DGIWG GMLJP2 version 1 profile.\r\nThe
    requirements for a DGIWG profile of GMLJP2 have been documented in the\r\nDGIWG
    GMLJP2 version 1 profile. The Imagery WG inside DGIWG has developed a\r\nfilter
    to map the files produced using the previous GMLJP2 schema into the GMLJP2\r\nversion
    2 schema and is about to submit a GMLJP2 2.0 profile to DGIWG.\r\nThe DGIWG implementation
    of the GMLJP2 profile is based on the OGC GMLJP2 v2\r\nand other requirements
    are coming directly from the adoption inside the DGIWG of the\r\nnew OGC GMLJP2
    version 2.\r\nThis Testbed 11 activity is a response to the need of harmonization
    between DGIWG and\r\nOGC."
