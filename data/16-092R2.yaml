abstract:
- content: "The Incident Management Information Sharing (IMIS) Internet of Things
    (IoT) Pilot established the following objectives.\r\n\r\n·       Apply Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) principles and practices for collaborative development to existing
    standards and technology in order to prototype an IoT approach to sensor use for
    incident management.\r\n\r\n·       Employ an agile methodology for collaborative
    development of system designs, specifications, software and hardware components
    of an IoT-inspired IMIS sensor capability.\r\n\r\n·       Development of profiles
    and extensions of existing Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) and other distributed computing
    standards to provide a basis for future IMIS sensor and observation interoperability.\r\n\r\n·
    \      Prototype capabilities documented in engineering reports and demonstrated
    in a realistic incident management scenario.\r\n\r\nThese principles continued
    through the IoT Pilot Extension, with additional objectives of:\r\n\r\n·       Integration
    into the existing Next Generation First Responder (NGFR) Apex development program
    process as part of Spiral 1;\r\n\r\n·       Defining steps to begin the integration
    of existing incident management infrastructure, e.g., pulling in National Institute
    of Emergency Management (NIEM) message feeds; and\r\n\r\n·       Demonstration
    and experimentation in a ‘realistic’ incident environment using two physically
    separate sites–an incident site within an active first responder training facility
    (Fairfax County Lorton site), and a command center (DHS S&T Vermont Avenue facility).\r\n\r\nThe
    initial Pilot activity has been documented in three OGC public engineering reports.
    The present report describes and documents the additional activities and innovations
    undertaken in the Extension."
