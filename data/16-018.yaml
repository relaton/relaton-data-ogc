abstract:
- content: This Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)Â® Engineering Report (ER) describes
    the architecture implemented in the OGC Testbed 12 Aviation thread. This report
    provides an overview of the technical architecture for the interoperable exchange
    of flight and aeronautical information using OGC services. The aviation architecture
    consists of multiple components developed by the Aviation thread, as well as specialized
    engineering reports per each work area. This report will provide an introduction
    to each work area and contain references to applicable reports. This report also
    describes the Aviation thread demonstration scenarios, outcomes, and benefits.
