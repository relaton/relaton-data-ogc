abstract:
- content: "The OGC Testbed 20 Coverage Format Selection Report (this document) provides
    an overview of use cases where the High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) can
    be used. For each use case, the different items and properties provided by the
    HEIF specification or by the proposed Geographic High Efficiency Image Format
    (GeoHEIF) extensions are selected. The use cases start with simple ones such as
    panchromatic or grey scale image and extend beyond photographic images into model
    outputs such as land cover classifications, atmosphere evolution, and weather
    forecast runs. Some other use cases consider actions such as map browsing (pan,
    zoom, clip…​), or special cases such as confidentiality or extraterrestrial imagery.\r\n\r\nThe
    three annexes in this Report include different points of view and considerations
    for how to do benchmarking of tiled imagery that can be the basis for a practical
    benchmarking future exercise.\r\n\r\nThe use case exercise was limited to still
    imagery and time series. In the future the set of use cases should be extended
    to motion imagery.\r\n\r\n"
