- content: This engineering report details Pilot experiences in connecting a variety
    of local communications protocols and message formats supported by low-cost sensor
    devices with OGC SWE Web services published globally over IP networks. It describes
    the Sensor Hub approach taken to support these connections and the mappings from
    one protocol to another required to develop integrated SWE-IoT networks.
