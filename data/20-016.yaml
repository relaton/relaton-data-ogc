- content: "This OGC Testbed-16 Engineering Report (ER) describes the work performed
    in the Data Access and Processing API (DAPA) thread.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of
    the DAPA thread is to develop methods and apparatus that simplify access to, processing
    of, and exchange of environmental and Earth Observation (EO) data from an end-user
    perspective. This ER presents:\r\n\r\nThe use cases participants proposed to guide
    the development of the client and server components deployed during the testbed.\r\n\r\nAn
    abstract description of a resource model that binds a specific function to specific
    data and also provides a means of expressing valid combinations of data and processes.\r\n\r\nA
    description of each DAPA endpoint developed and deployed during the testbed.\r\n\r\nA
    description of the client components that interact with the deployed DAPA endpoints.\r\n\r\nEnd-user
    (i.e. data scientist) feedback concerning the ease-of-use of the"
