abstract:
- content: "Coverages represent space/time-varying phenomena, such as satellite imagery,
    digital elevation models, or digital aerial imagery. OGC Abstract Topic 6 [OGC
    07-011] – which is identical to ISO 19123 – defines an abstract model of coverages.
    Coverage instances may be encoded using the GML Application Schema – Coverages
    – JPEG2000 Coverage Encoding Extension version 1.0 [OGC 12-108] which is based
    on the GML Application Schema – Coverages (GMLCOV) version 1.0 [OGC 09-146r2]
    which in turn is based on the Geography Markup Language (GML) version 3.2 [07-036],
    an XML grammar written in XML Schema for the description of application schemas
    as well as the transport and storage of geographic information.\r\n\r\nThis extension
    to the Web Coverage Service (WCS) 2.0 Interface Standard – Core (WCS) version
    2.0 [OC 09-110r4] specifies the usage of the JPEG2000 coverage encoding and JPIP
    streaming capabilities with WCS. The approach is based on the authoritative GML
    Application Schema – Coverages – JPEG2000 Coverage Encoding Extension version
    1.0 [OGC 12-108]."
