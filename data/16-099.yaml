- content: Numerous and diverse technologies push cities towards open and platform-independent
    information infrastructures to manage human, natural, and physical systems. Future
    Cities Pilot 1 is an OGC interoperability initiative that aims to demonstrate
    how cities can begin to reap the benefits of open standards. This document reports
    how Web Processing Standard (WPS) of OGC was successfully used in automating urban
    planning processes. This document details the implementation of urban planning
    processes and rules concerning urban development approval processes.
