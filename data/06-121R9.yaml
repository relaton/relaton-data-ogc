abstract:
- content: This document specifies many of the aspects that are, or should be, common
    to all or multiple OGC Web Service (OWS) interface Implementation Standards. These
    common aspects are primarily some of the parameters and data structures used in
    operation requests and responses. Of course, each such Implementation Standard
    must specify the additional aspects of that interface, including specifying all
    additional parameters and data structures needed in all operation requests and
    responses.
