abstract:
- content: "The OpenSearch specification [NR3] is defined as a binding of the Abstract
    Protocol Definition (APD) for the searchRetrieve operation, one of a set of documents
    [NR4] for the OASIS Search Web Services (SWS) initiative [OR1]. The OpenSearch
    Description Document (OSDD) allows clients to retrieve service metadata from an
    OpenSearch implementation. The OSDD format allows the use of extensions that allow
    search engines to inform clients about specific and contextual query parameters
    and response formats. The OpenSearch extension for Earth Observation (EO) collections
    and products search is defined in [OR20]. The mandatory response format is based
    on Atom 1.0/XML [OR14].\r\n\r\nJavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [NR1] has been
    gaining in popularity for encoding data in Web-based applications. JSON consists
    of sets of objects described by name/value pairs.  GeoJSON [NR2] is a format for
    encoding collections of simple geographical features along with their non-spatial
    attributes using JSON. This OGC standard describes a GeoJSON [NR2] and JSON-LD
    [NR15] encoding for OpenSearch Response documents.\r\n\r\nThe GeoJSON encoding
    defined in this document is defined as a compaction[1] through a normative context,
    of the proposed JSON-LD encoding, with some extensions as presented in section
    8 of this document.  Therefore, the JSON-LD encoding can also be applied to other
    RDF [OR8] encodings including RDF/XML [OR11] and RDF Turtle [OR12].\r\n\r\nAlthough
    this document makes no assumptions as to the “service” interfaces through which
    the Search Response is obtained and applies equally well to a Service Oriented
    Architecture as well as a Resource Oriented or RESTful architecture.  The documented
    approach is mainly intended to be applied in combination with the following technologies:\r\n\r\nOGC
    OpenSearch extensions [OR19], [OR20], [NR3].\r\nGeoJSON is a format for encoding
    collections of simple geographical features along with their non-spatial attributes
    using JSON. GeoJSON objects may represent a geometry, a feature, or a collection
    of features. GeoJSON supports the following geometry types derived from the OGC
    Simple Features specification: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString,
    MultiPolygon and GeometryCollection. Features in GeoJSON contain a geometry object
    and additional properties, and a feature collection represents a list of features.\r\n\r\nJSON
    is human readable and easily parseable. However, JSON is schemaless.  JSON and
    GeoJSON documents do not include an explicit definition of the structure of the
    JSON objects contained in them.  Therefore, this standard is based on a normative
    JSON-LD context which allows each property to be explicitly defined as a URI.
    \ Furthermore, the JSON encoding is defined using JSON Schema [OR24] which allows
    validation of instances against these schemas."
