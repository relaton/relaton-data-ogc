abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report (ER) summarizes the CDB sub-thread work in Testbed
    13. The document is structured in three phases and includes a feasibility study;
    the implementation of data models and schemas mapping that are based on the feasibility
    study results; and a set of OGC web services that implement the CDB in the form
    of WFS and WCS (Web Coverage Service) instances.\r\n\r\nThis Engineering Report
    describes:\r\n\r\nThe conceptual model of an OGC CDB 1.0 datastore as a UML (Unified
    Modeling Language) diagram to show different datasets (the 3D models, vector features
    and coverages) structure;\r\n\r\nHow to process and use a NAS-based Profile as
    a CDB feature/attribute data model or a GML-SF0 application schema;\r\n\r\nHow
    to access, navigate and visualize a CDB dataset using OGC web services (such as
    WFS and WCS).\r\n\r\nThis work provides insights into:\r\n\r\nThe in-depth study
    of the OGC CDB 1.0 feature data dictionary and attribution schema;\r\n\r\nThe
    requirements and constraints for extending the CDB feature data dictionary (FDD)
    and attribute schemas;\r\n\r\nThe development and prototyping of the WFS and WCS
    access to the CDB datastore for a NAS based urban military scenario."
