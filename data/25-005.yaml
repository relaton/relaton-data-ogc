abstract:
- content: "A STAC API is a dynamic version of a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog. This
    repository defines the three STAC API foundation specifications – STAC API - Core,
    STAC API - Features, and STAC API - Item Search – which can be composed with Extensions
    to define a specific STAC API implementation.\r\n\r\nA STAC API can be used to
    retrieve STAC Catalog, Collection, Item, or STAC API ItemCollection objects from
    various endpoints. Catalog and Collection objects are JSON, while Item and ItemCollection
    objects are GeoJSON-compliant entities with foreign members. Typically, a Feature
    is used when returning a single Item object, and FeatureCollection when multiple
    Item objects (rather than a JSON array of Item entities).\r\n\r\nThe API can be
    implemented in compliance with the OGC API - Features standard (OAFeat is a shorthand).
    In this case STAC API can be thought of as a specialized Features API to search
    STAC catalogs, where the features returned are STAC Item objects, that have common
    properties, links to their assets and geometries that represent the footprints
    of the geospatial assets.\r\n\r\nThe specification for STAC API is provided as
    files that follow the OpenAPI 3.0 specification, rendered online into HTML at
    https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0, in addition to human-readable documentation."
