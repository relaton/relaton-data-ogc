abstract:
- content: "BI is an umbrella term for a major component of IT infrastructure. It
    encompasses Data\r\nWarehouses, Business Analytics, Dashboards and Scorecards.
    This IT infrastructure is associated\r\nwith C-level decision-making in an organization.
    These decision-making tools have typically\r\nincluded location as a dumb attribute
    (coded sales zones as opposed to sales zones as geographic\r\nboundaries). At
    this point in the BI lifecycle, customers are looking to derive additional business\r\nbenefit
    / return on investment from intelligent location data; data discovery and unstructured
    data."
