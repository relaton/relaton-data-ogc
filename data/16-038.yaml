abstract:
- content: "The National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) GeoPackage Profile
    defines and tailors the implementable provisions prescribed for the NSG for a
    GeoPackage based on the OGC GeoPackage encoding standard. The profile provides
    detailed directions on how to use the clauses, options and parameters defined
    in the base GeoPackage standard. The goal is to ensure that NSG GeoPackages, GeoPackage
    SQLite Extensions, and supporting utilities and services fulfill their intended
    purposes and are fit for use.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this Engineering Report (ER)
    is to assess whether requirements as specified in the proposed profile are specific
    enough to allow for any two independent GeoPackage implementers to produce and
    consume interoperable NSG GeoPackages. Concerns with the profile are outlined
    and recommendations for improvement are provided. Thoughts on the viability of
    the profile approach and guidance on how the profile could apply to Vector Tiling
    are also provided."
