abstract:
- content: The OpenGIS notion of Information Communities was devised to enable groups
    such as ecologists and civil engineers to efficiently manage the semantics (or
    feature schema mismatches) of their own geodata collections and get maximum benefit
    from each other's geodata collections, despite semantic differences.
