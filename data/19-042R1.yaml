abstract:
- content: "This discussion paper documents and concludes one year (2018-2019) of
    work undertaken by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth
    Science Data System Working Group focused on exploring JSON Encodings in Earth
    Observation Coverages. The primary function of this paper is to ensure that the
    collective Working Group knowledge obtained from the year effort is not lost and
    consequently that it can be considered, debated and hopefully utilized in other
    forums outside of NASA with the aim of driving progress in this field. The covering
    statement (below) provides 10 questions which are meant to facilitate such discussion.\r\n\r\nThis
    discussion paper will be of particular interest to the following parties:\r\n\r\nWeb
    application developers tasked with designing and developing applications which
    consume Earth Observation spatial data encoded as JSON.\r\n\r\nParties (including
    standards bodies) interested in serving and consuming Spatial data on the Web
    e.g. World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) or developers
    of other data standards, etc."
