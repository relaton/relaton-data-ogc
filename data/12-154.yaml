abstract:
- content: "This OGCÂ® document provides mapping of the national imagery transmission
    format (NITF) version 2.1 format and NITF tagged record extensions (TRE) to GMLJP2
    v2.0 (draft) format.\r\nThis Engineering Report was prepared as a deliverable
    for the OGC Web Services, Phase 9 (OWS-9) initiative. \r\nThis document further
    describes study results of analyses of NITF and NITF extensions (TRE) capabilities
    and how they can be supported by GMLJP2 2.0 (draft). This activity was a part
    of the OGC OWS-9 Innovations thread.\r\n"
