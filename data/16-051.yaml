abstract:
- content: "The Testbed-11 deliverable OGC 15-053 Implementing JSON/GeoJSON in an
    OGC Standard ER enumerated strategies for implementing JSON in OGC services and
    OGC encodings. Previously, a mechanism to migrate XML into JSON was proposed by
    Pedro GonÃ§alves in 14-009r1 OGC Testbed-10 Rules for JSON and GeoJSON Adoption:
    Focus on OWS-Context. In contrast, this engineering report (ER) proposes a mechanism
    to derive JSON and JSON-LD encodings from UML modeling without using XML as an
    intermediate step. The rules provided can be divided into rules for JSON instances
    and rules for JSON schemas.\r\n\r\nThese rules have been applied to the UML diagrams
    in OWS common 2.0 to derive JSON encodings for them. In practice this ER evaluates
    how to provide service metadata in the derived JSON. JSON schemas and @context
    documents for independent validation of the four main sections of the ServiceMetadata
    are provided. This activity is done in connection with the OGC 16-052 OWS Context
    / Capabilities ER. The rules are applied to WMS to provide a full JSON encoding
    for the WMS 1.4 standard candidate.\r\n\r\nFinally, this ER discusses the applicability
    to data geospatial formats, both for coverage formats (compared to the CIS standard)
    and feature formats (compared to GeoJSON).\r\n\r\nReaders unfamiliar with JSON,
    JSON-LD and JSON Schema should first read OGC 16-122 (Geo)JSON User Guide. OGC
    16-122 includes guidelines and recommendations for the use of JSON and JSON-LD
    in OGC data encodings and services."
