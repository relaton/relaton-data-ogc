abstract:
- content: "The National Science Foundation (NSF) is developing EarthCube” - Towards
    a National Data Infrastructure for Earth System Science .  In a new partnership
    between GEO and the NSF Office of Cyberinfrastructure, NSF seeks transformative
    concepts and approaches to create a sustained, integrated data management infrastructure
    spanning the Geosciences.   Meeting the challenges in geoscience research requires
    innovation and paradigm shifts in cyberinfrastructure. Information technology
    must advance to meet the emerging approaches to science. A cyber-architecture
    identifies repeatable patterns, reusable components, and open standards that provide
    starting point for innovative developments.\r\nThis white paper was written by
    Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) members and associates to contribute to development
    of the NSF EarthCube.  This document does not represent an official position of
    the OGC.  However, the discussions in this document could very well lead to NSF
    developments and subsequent OGC documents. Recipients of this document are invited
    to reply to the authors’ with notification of any relevant patent rights of which
    they are aware and to provide supporting documentation.\r\n"
