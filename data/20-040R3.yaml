abstract:
- content: This Abstract Specification lays the foundations for Discrete Global Grid
    Systems (DGGS). It defines Common classes for spatio-temporal geometry, topology,
    and reference systems using identifiers, a DGGS Core Reference system as a reference
    system using zonal identifiers with structured geometry that may be spatio-temporal,
    a suite of DGGS Core Functions, and it specifies Equal-Area Earth DGGS. The OGC
    DGGS Abstract Specification supports the specification of standardized DGGS infrastructures
    that enable the integrated analysis of very large, multi-source, multi-resolution,
    multi-dimensional, distributed geospatial data. Interoperability between OGC DGGS
    implementations is anticipated through implementation standards, and extension
    interface encodings of OGC Web Services.
