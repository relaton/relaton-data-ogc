abstract:
- content: "KML is an XML grammar used to encode and transport representations of
    geographic data for display in an earth browser.  Put simply: KML encodes what
    to show in an earth browser, and how to show it.  KML uses a tag-based structure
    with nested elements and attributes and is based on the XML standard.\r\n\r\nThe
    KML community is wide and varied.  Casual users create KML Placemarks to identify
    their homes, describe journeys, and plan cross-country hikes and cycling ventures.
    \ Scientists use KML to provide detailed mappings of resources, models, and trends
    such as volcanic eruptions, weather patterns, earthquake activity, and mineral
    deposits.  Real estate professionals, architects, and city development agencies
    use KML to propose construction and visualize plans.  Students and teachers use
    KML to explore people, places, and events, both historic and current.  Organizations
    such as National Geographic, UNESCO, and the Smithsonian have all used KML to
    display their rich sets of global data.\r\n\r\nKML documents and their related
    images (if any) may be compressed using the ZIP format into KMZ archives.  KML
    documents and KMZ archives may be shared by e&#8209;mail, hosted locally for sharing
    within a private internet, or hosted on a web server."
