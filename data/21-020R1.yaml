abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed-17 Engineering Report (ER) documents the enhancement
    of applying Data Centric Security (DCS) to OGC API Features, OGC API Maps (draft),
    and OGC API Tiles (draft).\r\n\r\nAs organizations move to the cloud, it is important
    to incorporate DCS into the design of the new cloud infrastructure, enabling the
    use of cloud computing, even for sensitive geospatial data sets. The ER documents
    the applicability of Zero Trust through a Data Centric security approach (DCS)
    when applied to vector and binary geospatial data sets (Maps, Tiles, GeoPackage
    containers) and OGC APIs.\r\n\r\nThe defined architecture extends the typical
    Zero Trust Domain component by introducing a Key Management System (KMS) to support
    key registration and the management of access conditions for key retrieval. The
    prototype implementations (DCS Client, DCS Server and KMS) demonstrate how to
    request encrypted geospatial data as JSON for encrypted vector data, HTTP Multipart
    for encrypted map data or GeoPackage with encrypted content; how to obtain decryption
    key(s) and how to decrypt and display the protected data in a mobile application
    on Android."
