abstract:
- content: "This OGC Engineering Report (ER) documents the results of the CDB Vector
    Data in GeoPackage Interoperability Experiment (IE). The participants in this
    IE tested transforming CDB Shapefile vector data into one or more GeoPackage(s)
    and storing the result in a CDB data store. GeoPackage Version 1.2 and CDB Version
    1.1 and related Best Practices were the standards baseline used for this experiment.
    The IE builds on the work described in the OGC CDB, Leveraging GeoPackage Discussion
    Paper.\r\n\r\nA primary objective of this IE was to agree and document possible
    change requests and/or best practices for storing vector data in a CDB data using
    encodings and/or containers other than Shapefiles. These suggested changes requests
    and/or best/practices will be used as the basis for CDB Standards Working Group
    (SWG) discussions related to possible revisions to the CDB standard."
