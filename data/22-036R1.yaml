abstract:
- content: Currently, most OGC Standards focus on data that is observed on the ground
    or near the Earthâ€™s surface. Extra-terrestrial space and the exact location of
    remote sensors has been less in focus. Current OGC Standardizations cannot be
    applied to this type of spatial data processing. This OGC Testbed 18 Engineering
    Report (ER) first provides a detailed description of existing Standards, conventions,
    and tools which are particularly relevant for further evaluation. Subsequently,
    various coordinate and time systems are presented and improvements or extensions
    to existing Standards are proposed to describe objects in orbit around any celestial
    body or interplanetary flight through our solar system.
