abstract:
- content: "Portrayal of geospatial information plays a crucial role in situation
    awareness, analysis and decision-making. Visualizing geospatial information often
    requires one to portray the information using symbology or cartographic presentation
    rules from a community or organization. For example, among those in the law enforcement,
    fire and rescue community, various local, national and international agencies
    use different symbols and terminology for the same event, location and building,
    employing syntactic, structural-based and document-centric data models (e.g.,
    eXtensible Markup Language (XML) schemas and Style Layer Descriptors (SLD)). With
    this approach, interoperability does not extend to the semantic level, which makes
    it difficult to share, reuse and mediate unambiguous portrayal information between
    agencies.\r\n\r\nThis Engineering Report (ER) captures the requirements, solutions,
    models and implementations of the Testbed 13 Portrayal Package. This effort leverages
    the work on Portrayal Ontology development and Semantic Portrayal Service conducted
    during Testbed 10, 11 and 12. The objective of this Testbed 13 is to identify
    and complete the gaps in the latest version of the portrayal ontology defined
    in Testbed 12, complete the implementation of the Semantic Portrayal Service by
    adding rendering capabilities and performing a demonstration of the portrayal
    service that showcases the benefits of the proposed semantic-based approach."
