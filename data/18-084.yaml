abstract:
- content: The Geospatial to the Edge Interoperability Plugfest, co-sponsored by the
    Army Geospatial Center and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA/CIO&T),
    brought together technology implementers and data providers to advance the interoperability
    of geospatial products and services based on profiles of OGC standards. Specifically,
    servers and data available via GeoPackage, Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Map
    Service (WMS), and Web Map Tile Service (WMTS), all following National System
    for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG) profiles, were exercised and improved in various
    clients. Compliance Tests were executed and advanced based on feedback from the
    participants.
