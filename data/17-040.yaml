abstract:
- content: This engineering report captures the requirements, solutions, and implementation
    experiences of the Semantic Registry work package in Testbed-13. The engineering
    report describes the implementation of a RESTful Semantic Registry that supports
    the Semantic Registry Information Model (SRIM) which is based on the Data Catalog
    (DCAT) specification. A discussion of the applicability of the SRIM to the United
    States Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency
    (NGA) metadata is also presented, including an analysis of a set of controlled
    vocabularies from both organizations. Best Practice guidelines for the use of
    SRIM are also provided. The engineering report discusses the application of Shapes
    Constraint Language (SHACL) to aspects of Linked Data. Recognizing the benefits
    that asynchronous access has to offer web services, a description of the work
    undertaken by the testbed in implementing publish/subscribe functionality between
    a Semantic Registry and a Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW) is also presented.
