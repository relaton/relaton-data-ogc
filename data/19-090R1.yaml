abstract:
- content: 'In this paper, we present an experiment on linking geo-referenced images
    and videos with CityGML objects. Data models are proposed with XML schema from
    two viewpoints: one for linking features in 2D images or videos with 3D CityGML
    objects and the other for camera FoV (Field of View). In order to validate the
    proposed data models, we developed an authoring tool for building XML documents
    to link geo-referenced images and videos with CityGML objects and a web environment
    for processing queries based on the linking data.'
