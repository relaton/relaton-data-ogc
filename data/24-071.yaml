abstract:
- content: "As part of OGC Disasters and Climate Resilience Pilot IV (D123 â€” AI Advances
    of SDIs Report Section), this D-123 Generative AI in Wildland Fire (WF) Management
    Engineering Report \r\nfocus was to assess the domain adaptation needed for Generative
    AI to support advancements in the wildland fire community as informed by user
    needs assessments as well as technical assessments of potential advances and efficiencies.\r\nThe
    Wildland Fire community leverages data and advanced tools to enhance planning
    and \r\noperational decision-making, aiming to supplement rather than replace
    experiential knowledge \r\nand anecdotal evidence. GenAI, while early in its technical
    evolution, with a human-in-the-loop approach, offers transformative potential
    by enabling scalability in data processing beyond human capabilities.\r\nExploring
    GenAI further, particularly in scenarios where significant efficiency gains are
    feasible, \r\nis imperative. Integrating GenAI into wildfire management necessitates
    a comprehensive strategy encompassing data, process, technical, and ethical considerations.
    This report explores the needed input, tools, challenges, and recommendations
    for next steps to implementing GenAI to support the Wildland Fire Management lifecycle."
