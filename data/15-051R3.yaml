abstract:
- content: "The goal of the Geo4NIEM thread in Testbed 11 was to assess the potential
    for the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) to be combined with security
    tags from Intelligence Community (IC) Data Encoding Specifications for information
    exchange. The assessment included reviewing Information Exchange Package Documentation
    (IEPD) populated with relevant content and IC security tags – and then deploying
    these instance documents on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards enabled
    Web Services for testing. The security tags included Information Security Marking
    Metadata (ISM) and Need-to-Know (NTK) Metadata for secure information exchange.
    \r\nThe assessment included reviewing example IEPDs and performing tests and demonstrations
    using OGC web services, such as Transactional Web Feature Services (WFS-T), Policy
    Enforcement Points (PEPs) and OGC Attribute Stores to process geographic feature
    with NIEM components and security tags. The Test and Demonstration included, but
    was not limited to, feature retrieval and transactions. Results were documented
    in this task to provide a preliminary architecture for Geo4NIEM in Testbed 11,
    and were described in technical detail in other OGC Testbed 11 Engineering Reports.
    \ \r\nThis document describes background considerations – and an overview of the
    services, data encodings and access control frameworks that compose the Geo4NIEM
    Testbed 11 architecture. This document must be reviewed in conjunction with the
    following Testbed 11 Geo4NIEM ERs:\r\n•\t15-048 Testbed11_Engineering_Report_NIEM-IC
    Data Encoding Specification Assessment and Recommendations\r\n•\t15-047 Testbed11_Engineering_Report
