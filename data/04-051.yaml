abstract:
- content: 'Image Handling is a thread in the OGC Web Services 1.2 (OWS1.2).  This
    document defines the system design for Image Handling in OWS1.2.  The system design
    responds to the requirements in OWS 1.2 Image Handling Requirements.  The system
    design specifies two main services: Image Archive Service and Image Catalogue
    Service.  Interfaces for these two services are defined using previously defined
    OWS service interfaces.  '
