abstract:
- content: This document reports on outcomes from the OGC Web Services Shibboleth
    Interoperability Experiment (OSI).  The main objective of OSI was to advance the
    use of Shibboleth (an open source implementation of SAML) as a means of protecting
    OWS.  In the process, OSI helped develop further understanding of this approach
    to establishing trusted federations of OWS.  This report documents these findings
    and is intended to be of use to those interested in how Shibboleth/SAML access
    management federations may function as an organisational model for operational
    Spatial Data Infrastructure.
