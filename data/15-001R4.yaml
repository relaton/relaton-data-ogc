abstract:
- content: "The 3D Portrayal Service Standard is a geospatial 3D content delivery
    implementation specification. It focuses on what is to be delivered in which manner
    to enable interoperable 3D portrayal.\r\n\r\nIt does not define or endorse particular
    content transmission formats, but specifies how geospatial 3D content is described,
    selected, and delivered. It does not prescribe how aforementioned content is to
    be organized and represented, but provides a framework to determine whether 3D
    content is interoperable at the content representation level. More details are
    available in Design of this standard."
