abstract:
- content: "CityGML is an open data model and XML-based format for the storage and
    exchange of virtual 3D city models. It is an application schema for the Geography
    Markup Language version 3.1.1 (GML3), the extendible international standard for
    spatial data exchange issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the ISO
    TC211.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition
    of the basic entities, attributes, and relations of a 3D city model. This is especially
    important with respect to the cost-effective sustainable maintenance of 3D city
    models, allowing the reuse of the same data in different application fields. \r\n"
