abstract:
- content: 'This Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard defines the conceptual
    model for the OGC CDB 1.0 Standard. The objective of this document is to provide
    an abstract core conceptual model for a CDB data store (repository). The model
    is represented using UML (unified modeling language). The conceptual model is
    comprised of concepts, schema, classes and categories as well as their relationships,
    which are used to understand, and/or represent an OGC CDB data store. This enables
    a comparison and description of the CDB data store structure on a more detailed
    level. This document was created by reverse-engineering a UML model and documentation
    from the OGC CDB standard as a basis for supporting OGC interoperability. One
    of the important roles of this conceptual model is to provide a UML model that
    is consistent with the other OGC standards and to identify functional gaps between
    the current CDB data store and the OGC standards baseline.  This document references
    sections of Volume 1: OGC CDB Core Standard: Model and Physical Database Structure
    [OGC 15-113].'
