abstract:
- content: "This report provides guidance for implementing the Flight Information
    Exchange Model (FIXM) using the same best practice as the Aeronautical Information
    Exchange Model (AIXM) and the Weather Information Exchange Model (WXXM) by adopting
    ISO and OGC standards.\r\nThe report is aimed at system and client developers
    that shall use the FIXM data encoding for the exchange of flight information.\r\nThis
    document is a deliverable for the OGC Testbed 10 (Testbed-10) testbed activity.
    OWS testbeds are part of OGC's Interoperability Program, a global, hands-on and
    collaborative prototyping program designed to rapidly develop, test and deliver
    proven candidate standards or revisions to existing standards into OGC's Standards
    Program, where they are formalized for public release. In OGC's Interoperability
    Initiatives, international teams of technology providers work together to solve
    specific geoprocessing interoperability problems posed by the Initiative's sponsoring
    organizations. OGC Interoperability Initiatives include testbeds, pilot projects,
    interoperability experiments and interoperability support services - all designed
    to encourage rapid development, testing, validation and adoption of OGC standards.\r\nThe
    Testbed-10 sponsors are organizations seeking open standard for their interoperability
    requirements. After analyzing their requirements, the OGC Interoperability Team
    recommends to the sponsors that the content of the Testbed-10 initiative be organized
    around the following threads:\r\n•\tCross-Community Interoperability (CCI)\r\n•\tOpen
    Mobility\r\n•\tAviation\r\nMore information about the Testbed-10 tested can be
    found at:\r\nhttp://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/requests/103\r\n"
