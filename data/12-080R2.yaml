abstract:
- content: "This standard describes the use cases, requirements and conceptual model
    for the OWS Context encoding standard. The goal of this standard is to provide
    a core model, which is extended and encoded as defined in extensions to this standard.
    A ‘context document’ specifies a fully configured service set which can be exchanged
    (with a consistent interpretation)  among clients supporting the standard.\r\nThe
    OGC Web Services Context Document (OWS Context) was created to allow a set of
    configured information resources (service set) to be passed between applications
    primarily as a collection of services. OWS Context is developed to support in-line
    content as well. The goal is to support use cases such as the distribution of
    search results, the exchange of a set of resources such as OGC Web Feature Service
    (WFS), Web Map Service (WMS), Web Map Tile Service (WMTS), Web Coverage Service
    (WCS) and others in a ‘common operating picture’. Additionally OWS Context can
    deliver a set of configured processing services (Web Processing Service (WPS))
    parameters to allow the processing to be reproduced on different nodes.\r\nOWS
    Context is aimed at replacing previous OGC attempts at providing such a capability
    (the Web Map Context WMC) which was reasonably successful but limited to WMS.
    Other work on the ‘Location Organizer Folder (LOF)’ was also taken into consideration.
    The concept of OWS Context, and the first prototype document was produced as part
    of OGC testbed OWS-7. See OGC 10-035r1, Information Sharing Engineering Report.
    In order to achieve mass market appeal, as well as being useful to a wider community,
    the use of OWS Context support to other existing standards was considered. Multiple
    encoding formats for OWS Context have been developed (ATOM, JSON). Each of these
    is described in a separate OWS Context Extensions to the Core model.\r\nThis document
    concentrates on describing the OWS Context Model in abstract terms using UML.
    The document defines requirements and use cases. It also includes an abstract
    test suite to verify that encodings are compliant with the core specification.
    The intent of OWS Context is to allow many types of OGC Data Delivery service
    to be referenced and therefore exploited (for example, not just WMS but also WFS,
    WCS and WPS) but it does not explicitly define the encoding of these services
    in the core (only the general approach to be used for different types of service
    interface). Service explicit encodings are defined within the extension documents
    for ATOM and JSON.\r\nThe abbreviation owc is used throughout this document for
    OWS Context.\r\n"
