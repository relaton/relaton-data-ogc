abstract:
- content: Annotation of Web Services or data compliant to OGC standards refers to
    the task of attaching meaningful descriptions to the service and the served geospatial
    data or processes. In this discussion paper we try to extend the expressiveness
    of such annotations by including more sophisticated (semantic) descriptions.
