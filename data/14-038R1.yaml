abstract:
- content: "This OGC document provides an analysis of the mapping between the NOAA
    Web Gridded Document Service (WGDS) and the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS)  and
    describes an adapter which translates WCS 2.0 requests to WGDS requests and then
    translates WGDS responses to WCS 2.0  responses.\r\nThis Engineering Report was
    prepared as a deliverable for the OGC Testbed 10 (Testbed-10) initiative, specifically
    the Testbed 10 Aviation Thread.\r\n"
