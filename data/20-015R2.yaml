abstract:
- content: "This engineering report describes the work performed in the Machine Learning
    Thread of OGCâ€™s Testbed-16 initiative.\r\n\r\nPrevious OGC testbed tasks concerned
    with Machine Learning (ML) concentrated on the methods and apparatus of training
    models to produce high quality results. The work reported in this ER, however,
    focuses less on the accuracy of machine models and more on how the entire machine
    learning processing chain from discovering training data to visualizing the results
    of a ML model run can be integrated into a standards-based data infrastructure
    specifically based on OGC interface standards.\r\n\r\nThe work performed in this
    thread consisted of:\r\n\r\nTraining ML models;\r\n\r\nDeploying trained ML models;\r\n\r\nMaking
    deployed ML models discoverable;\r\n\r\nExecuting an ML model;\r\n\r\nPublishing
    the results from executing a ML model;\r\n\r\nVisualizing the results from running
    a ML model.\r\n\r\nAt each step, the following OGC and related standards were
    integrated into the workflow to provide an infrastructure upon which the above
    activities were performed:\r\n\r\nOGC API - Features: Approved OGC Standard that
    provides API building blocks to create, retrieve, modify and query features on
    the Web.\r\n\r\nOGC API - Coverages: Draft OGC Standard that provides API building
    blocks to create, retrieve, modify and query coverages on the Web.\r\n\r\nOGC
    API - Records: Draft OGC Standard that provides API building block to create,
    modify and query catalogues on the Web.\r\n\r\nApplication Deployment and Execution
    Service: Draft OGC Standard that provides API building blocks to deploy, execute
    and retrieve results of processes on the Web.\r\n\r\nMapML is a specification
    that was published by the Maps For HTML Community Group. It extends the base HTML
    map element to handle the display and editing of interactive geographic maps and
    map data without the need of special plugins or JavaScript libraries. The Design
    of MapML resolves a Web Platform gap by combining map and map data semantics into
    a hypermedia format that is syntactically and architecturally compatible with
    and derived from HTML. It provides a standardized way for declarative HTML content
    to communicate with custom spatial server software (which currently use HTTP APIs
    based on multiple queries and responses). It allows map and map data semantics
    to be either included in HTML directly, or referred to at arbitrary URLs that
    describe stand-alone layers of map content, including hyper-linked annotations
    to further content.\r\n\r\nParticular emphasis was placed on using services based
    on the emerging OGC API Framework suite of API building blocks."
