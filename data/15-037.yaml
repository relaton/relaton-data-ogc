abstract:
- content: "Responding to an oil spill requires access to and understanding of many
    types of information. Effective, coordinated operations for the response are based
    on a shared, common picture of the situation. Interoperability provides shared
    situational awareness of the crisis and the response activities. What is needed
    is a common picture of reality for different organizations that have different
    views of the spill so that they all can deal with it collectively.\r\nRecent oil
    spills have provided lessons learned and recommendations on forming a Common Operating
    Picture for oil spill response. Through a joint project, industry is responding
    to the call, moving from recommendations to reusable best practices supported
    by open standards that can be deployed quickly in any region of the globe.\r\nThis
    architecture report is part of The International Association of Oil & Gas Producers
    and IPIECA Oil Spill Response - Joint Industry Project (IOGP–IPIECA OSR-JIP) to
    produce a recommended practice for GIS/mapping in support of oil spill response
    and for the use of GIS technology and geospatial information in forming a “Common
    Operating Picture” to support management of the response.\r\nInteroperability
    seems to be at first a technical topic, but in fact, it is about organization.
    Interoperability seems to be about the integration of information. What it’s really
    about is the coordination of organizational behavior. The Oil Spill Response Common
    Operating Picture (OSR COP) project seeks to facilitate the coordination of organizational
    response to any oil spill in the future."
