abstract:
- content: "GeoPose 1.0 is an OGC Implementation Standard for exchanging the location
    and orientation of real or virtual geometric objects (“Poses”) within reference
    frames anchored to the earth’s surface (“Geo”) or within other astronomical coordinate
    systems.\r\n\r\nThe standard specifies two Basic forms with no configuration options
    for common use cases, an Advanced form with more flexibility for more complex
    applications, and five composite GeoPose structures that support time series plus
    chain and graph structures.\r\n\r\nThese eight Standardization Targets are independent.
    There are no dependencies between Targets and each may be implemented as needed
    to support a specific use case.\r\n\r\nThe Standardization Targets share an implementation-neutral
    Logical Model which establishes the structure and relationships between GeoPose
    components and also between GeoPose data objects themselves in composite structures.
    Not all of the classes and properties of the Logical Model are expressed in individual
    Standardization Targets nor in the specific concrete data objects defined by this
    standard. Those elements that are expressed are denoted as implementation-neutral
    Structural Data Units (SDUs). SDUs are aliases for elements of the Logical Model,
    isolated to facilitate specification of their use in encoded GeoPose data objects
    for a specific Standardization Target.\r\n\r\nFor each Standardization Target,
    each implementation technology and corresponding encoding format defines the encoding
    or serialization specified in a manner appropriate to that technology.\r\n\r\nGeoPose
    1.0 specifies a single encoding in JSON format (IETF RFC 8259). Each Standardization
    Target has a JSON Schema (Internet-Draft draft-handrews-json-schema-02) encoding
    specification. The key standardization requirements specify that concrete JSON-encoded
    GeoPose data objects must conform to the corresponding JSON Schema definition.
    The individual elements identified in the encoding specification are composed
    of SDUs, tying the specifications back to the Logical Model.\r\n\r\nThe GeoPose
    1.0 Standard makes no assumptions about the interpretation of external specifications,
    for example, of reference frames. Nor does it assume or constrain services or
    interfaces providing conversion between GeoPoses of difference types or relying
    on different external reference frame definitions.\r\n\r\n"
