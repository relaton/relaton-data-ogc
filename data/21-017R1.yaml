abstract:
- content: "The OGC Testbed-17 Features and Geometries JSON task investigated proposals
    for how feature data could be encoded in JSON so that:\r\n\r\n* Different Coordinate
    Reference Systems (CRS) are supported and\r\n* Communities can build and formally
    specify profiles of the fully CRS-enabled JSON with limited sets of supported
    geometry types and with clear constraints for feature type definitions.\r\n\r\nGeoJSON,
    a standard of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), was used as a starting
    point.\r\n\r\nThis Engineering Report (ER) captures the results and discussions,
    including material that was submitted to the https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-feat-geo-json[OGC
    Features and Geometries JSON Standards Working Group].\r\n"
