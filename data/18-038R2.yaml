abstract:
- content: "This OGC Engineering Report (ER) describes the application and use of
    OGC Web Services (OWS) for integrating Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL)
    and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the OGC Testbed-14 Modeling, Portrayal, and
    Quality of Service (MoPoQ) Thread. This report is intended to present a holistic
    approach on how to support and integrate emerging AI and ML tools using OWS, as
    well as publishing their input and outputs. This approach should seek efficiency
    and effectiveness of knowledge sharing.\r\n\r\nThis engineering report will describe:
    experiences, lessons learned, best practices for workflows, service interaction
    patterns, application schemas, and use of controlled vocabularies. It is expected
    that the description of workflows for geospatial feature extraction will be more
    complex than the implementations found in the deliverables."
