abstract:
- content: 'This Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Engineering Report (ER) will describe
    the advancement of an Execution Management System (EMS) to support Web Processing
    Service (WPS) climate processes deployed on the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF).
    The report introduces climate data, processes and applications into Common Workflow
    Language (CWL) workflows with the intent of advancing: application packaging,
    deployment and execution in clouds; interoperability of services in federated
    cyberinfrastructures; and geospatial workflows towards standardization. Work presented
    in this report is a direct continuation of the Earth Observation & Clouds (EOC)
    thread of Testbed-14. This report is expected to be of relevance to Testbed-15,
    both to the Earth Observation Process and Application Discovery (EOPAD) task and
    the Machine Learning task. This engineering report will describe: relevant work
    conducted in OGC Testbed-14; ESGF and its compute challenge; adaptations of existing
    climate processes into workflows; interoperability experiments with ESGF endpoints
    conforming to a common API.'
