abstract:
- content: "This document describes an information model for exchanging rating tables,
    or rating\r\ncurves, that are used for the conversion of related hydrological
    phenomenon. It also\r\ndescribes a model describing the observations that are
    used to develop such relationships,\r\noften referred to as gauging observations.\r\nThe
    information model is proposed as a second part of the WaterML2.0 suite of\r\nstandards,
    building on part 1 that addresses the exchange of time series1."
