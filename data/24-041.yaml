abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 20 GIMI Benchmarking Report documents the evaluation
    of implementations of the OGC Geographic Tagged Image File Format (GeoTIFF) Standard
    and Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) to see how they perform compared to the new
    GEOINT Imagery Media for ISR (GIMI) standard. The Testbed 20 GIMI participants
    created various datasets using data from satellites such as Sentinel-1 and Landsat
    and for comparison synthetic data. Synthetic data are artificially generated rather
    than produced by real-world events.\r\n\r\nCOGs were tested under controlled conditions
    and practical situations. The participants noted challenges such as managing complex
    data during conversion and limitations of support in certain programming environments.
    Also, using implementations of the High Efficiency Image Format (HEIF) can significantly
    reduce file sizes compared to PNG tiles. This makes GeoHEIF comparable to PNG
    even for simple files when combined with a low-overhead image file format. Furthermore,
    the assessment included comparing the performance of reading GeoTIFF and GeoHEIF
    files using a custom pure-Java reader and a C/C++ GDAL library binding in a Java
    environment. The experiment highlighted the need for repeated full benchmarks
    and the use of specialized tools for accurate statistical analysis due to variations
    in execution time. The focus was on understanding the costs and efficiency of
    these different methods, particularly in terms of how data is managed across programming
    languages."
