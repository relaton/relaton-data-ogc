abstract:
- content: 'This OGC Discussion Paper provides a comparison between the OGC CityGML
    and IndoorGML standards. The goals and approaches of these two standards are different
    and they can be used in a complementary way. This discussion paper aims to compare
    the strengths and weakness of the standards, and explain how to integrate the
    standards to make useful applications. These comparative experiments are based
    on a real site: a shopping mall at Lotte World Mall in Seoul, South Korea.'
