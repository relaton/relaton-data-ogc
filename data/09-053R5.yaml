abstract:
- content: This document covers Geoprocessing Workflow best practices and methods
    in a SOA environment. A RESTful approach was also conducted in this testbed, but
    no specific implementation details were available to be included in this ER; also,
    the RESTful workflow approaches and technology used in this testbed was essentially
    same as that used in OWS-5.
