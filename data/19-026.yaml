abstract:
- content: "This OGC Engineering Report (ER) documents the results and experiences
    resulting from the Federated Cloud Analytics task of OGC Testbed-15. More specifically,
    this ER provides an analysis of:\r\n\r\nThe potential for the OGC Web Processing
    Service (WPS) Interface Standard as an Application Programming Interface (API)
    to a workflow automation service for managing job execution involving multiple
    containers in the Scale Data Center Environment;\r\n\r\nUsing an implementation
    of the OGC WPS standard as a general frontend to workflow automation with containers;\r\n\r\nThe
    suitability of the OGC WPS 2.0 standard as an API for Cloud analytics;\r\n\r\nUsing
    OGC Web Services (WS) as analytics data sources and sinks."
