abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the interface to a Web Coordinate Transformation
    Service (WCTS), which can be used by geospatial applications and other services.
    Transformation of geospatial data from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to
    another is frequently required when using data from different sources in one application.
    That is, geospatial data are often stored in different coordinate reference systems
    (CRSs). To use together data stored in different CRSs, such data must be transformed
    or converted into the same CRS. Not all applications or services are capable of
    directly performing such transformations. \r\n\r\nThis document specifies an OGC
    Web Service type of interface to a service that performs coordinate transformations.
    Such transformations include all the types of coordinate operations, including
    both transformations and conversions. This service inputs digital features or
    coverages in one CRS and outputs the same features in a different CRS. The service
    inputs include identifications of the input and output CRSs, and optionally the
    coordinate transformation between these CRSs.\r\n"
