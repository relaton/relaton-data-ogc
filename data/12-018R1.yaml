abstract:
- content: "This report describes the methods, results, issues and recommendations
    generated by\r\nthe Surfacewater Interoperability Experiment (SW IE), carried
    out as an activity of the\r\nOGC Hydrology Domain Working Group (HDWG). The SW
    IE was designed to\r\nadvance the development of WaterML 2.0 and test its use
    with various OGC service\r\nstandards (SOS, WFS, WMS and CSW). A secondary aim
    was to contribute to the\r\ndevelopment of a hydrology domain feature model and
    vocabularies, which are\r\nessential for interoperability in the hydrology domain,
    although these are not the main\r\nfocus for the IE."
