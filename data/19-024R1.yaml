abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed-15 Engineering Report (ER) documents the concept for
    different types of federation through the lens of security. The primary focus
    of the work documented in this ER is on analyzing how federated membership, resource
    and access policy management can be provided within a security environment, while
    also providing portability and interoperability to all stakeholders.\r\n\r\nIn
    the Testbed, a practical approach for providing this functionality was exercised
    and documented for two administrative domains: One based on a centralized entity
    (Federation Manager) and the other showcasing a distributed architecture."
