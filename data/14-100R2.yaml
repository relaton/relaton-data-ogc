abstract:
- content: "The OGC CF-netCDF data model supports multi-dimensional gridded data and
    multidimensional multi-point data, representing space and time-varying phenomena.
    In particular, this extension standard is limited to multi-point, and regular
    and warped grids.\r\nThis standard specifies the CF-netCDF data model encoding
    using the OGC GML 3.2.1 coverage application schema, as well as CF-netCDF data
    exchange format and protocol encoding.\r\nThis standard specifies: (a) the CF-netCDF
    GML encoding to be used by OGC standards; (b) the CF-netCDF data format exchanged
    using OGC standards; (c) the Internet protocol characteristics to effectively
    exchange CF-netCDF data.\r\nAs per the GML 3.3. standard, GML 3.3 imports the
    3.2 schema. The canonical location of the 3.2 all components schema document for
    3.3 is\r\nhttp://schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.2.1/gml.xsd"
