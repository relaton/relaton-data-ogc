abstract:
- content: "This OGC Engineering Report (ER) documents findings of the CCIP 2009 Plugfest,
    which was conducted via the public Internet to address requirements stated in
    the CCIP Call for Participation . It addresses concept development, specifications
    tested, and interoperability experiments conducted. The ER concludes with issues
    that arose, and provides recommendations for the refinement of OGC Specifications
    and the Plugfest process.  Recommendations in this ER will be considered in the
    planning of future activities.\r\nOGC expresses thanks to the Australian Bureau
    of Meteorology and to CSIRO for sponsoring CCIP 2009.\r\n"
