abstract:
- content: "n an era of growing data volumes and geospatial analysis demands, maintaining
    Integrity, Provenance, and Trust (IPT) is critical, especially in distributed
    systems where data availability can fluctuate. The OGC Testbed 20 IPT activity
    addresses this need by developing resilient data services that safeguard IPT throughout
    the data lifecycle. Two IPT Server instances were demonstrated in the Testbed
    20 IPT activity by Secure Dimensions, which used the Federated Agile Collaborative
    Trusted System (FACTS) to manage Smart Certificates, and Spacebel, which leveraged
    Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for data verification.
    These servers ensure that data remains reliable and traceable by validating its
    origin and history, supporting cross-organizational trust without altering legacy
    data formats.\r\n\r\nThe FACTS ecosystem that was demonstrated by Secure Dimensions
    provides a trusted process for managing data through Smart Certificates. The two
    processes demonstrated, Trusted Teapot and Trusted Watermarking, validated certificates,
    maintained data integrity, and generated new certificates for outputs. Meanwhile,
    Spacebelâ€™s IPT Server demonstrated verification and authenticity of Earth Observation
    (EO) data sources, ensuring the integrity of information exchanged within the
    EO data supply chain. Together, these IPT Server instances provide examples of
    scalable frameworks for applying IPT principles, supporting the development of
    resilient data services that uphold reliability and trust across distributed networks.\r\n\r\nTo
    validate cross-component compatibility and demonstrate seamless data exchange,
    nine Technical Interoperability Experiments (TIEs) were conducted between these
    IPT servers and various tools, including a PDF Generator from SatCen and tools
    like UniResolver and UniVerifier. These experiments successfully established interoperability
    between Smart Certificates and Verifiable Credentials, confirming the flexibility
    and scalability of the IPT systems. Additionally, the TIEs identified challenges
    such as the need for JSON-LD 1.1 compatibility and suggested alternative encoding
    strategies, enhancing the potential for IPT systems to support diverse geospatial
    data services in real-world scenarios."
