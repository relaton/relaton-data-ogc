abstract:
- content: "This OGC Engineering Report (ER) will describe the use of OGC Web Processing
    Service (WPS) for cloud architecture in the OGC Testbed 13 Earth Observation Cloud
    (EOC) Thread. This report is intended to address issues in lack of interoperability
    and portability of cloud computing architectures which cause difficulty in managing
    the efficient use of virtual infrastructure such as in cloud migration, storage
    transference, quantifying resource metrics, and unified billing and invoicing.
    This engineering report will describe the current state of affairs in cloud computing
    architectures and describe the participant architectures based on use case scenarios
    from sponsor organizations.\r\n\r\nCloud computing is paving the way for future
    scalable computing infrastructures and is being used for processing digital earth
    observation data. In this EOC thread effort, data is stored in various storage
    resources in the cloud and accessed by an OGC Web Processing Service. The methods
    in which these processes are deployed and managed must be made interoperable to
    mitigate or avoid the complexities of administrative effort for the scientific
    community. In other words, the intent of this effort is to develop a way for scientists
    to acquire, process, and consume earth observation data without needing to administer
    computing cloud resources."
