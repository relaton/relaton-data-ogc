abstract:
- content: "The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) GeoPackage Encoding Standard was
    developed for the purpose of providing an open, standards-based, platform-independent,
    portable, self-describing, compact format for transferring geospatial information.
    GeoPackage has proven to be an effective container mechanism for bundling and
    sharing geospatial data for a variety of operational use cases. However, GeoPackage
    stakeholders have observed persistent interoperability issues, particularly with
    regards to metadata, extensions, and portrayal.\r\n\r\nThis paper presents the
    operational need, proposed approach, and way ahead for addressing these interoperability
    issues. Section 6 presents three new enhancements (extensions) that are designed
    to improve the interoperability of GeoPackages in general and metadata in particular.
    Section 7 presents a vision for implementing an Open Portrayal Framework in GeoPackage.
    Annex A presents specifications for all of the GeoPackage extensions proposed
    in this paper. Annex B presents a JSON schema for the proposed encoding for application
    profiles presented in Section 6. In general, the GeoPackage Standards Working
    Group (SWG) looks to standardize extensions that address a clear use case, have
    a sound technical approach, and have a commitment to implementation by multiple
    organizations. As with the GeoPackage Tiled Gridded Coverage Extension and the
    GeoPackage Related Tables Extension, these new extensions would be tracked as
    separate documents from the core GeoPackage Encoding Standard.\r\n\r\nThe GeoPackage
    community will benefit from the increased interoperability of operational “mission-ready”
    GeoPackages that will result from this approach. Additionally, software will be
    able to quickly determine the validity and utility of a GeoPackage in target operational
    environments. This will help ensure that GeoPackage production-consumption lifecycles
    and supporting application tools and services are better aligned with stakeholder
    missions."
