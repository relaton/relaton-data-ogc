abstract:
- content: "Point cloud data are unstructured three-dimensional sample points to express
    the basic shape of objects and spaces. However, it is challenging to automatically
    generate continuous surfaces and infer semantic structures, such as cars, trees,
    buildings and roads, from a dataset of point clouds generated by a sensor. The
    understanding of the semantic structures is essential for recording geospatial
    information. Despite the good performance of deep learning-based approaches in
    understanding point clouds, their target coverage is still limited by the lack
    of training datasets that include semantic labels. This discussion paper addresses
    data formats to share a Labeled Point Cloud (LPC), in which point-level semantic
    information is annotated to each point.\r\n\r\nCreating LPCs manually or semi-manually
    is a time-consuming task. Therefore, sharing LPCs in an open standard format is
    becoming increasingly important for the development of more advanced deep learning
    algorithms for object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.
    Even though several data formats are used to distribute LPC, there is a variety
    to represent the semantic information depending on distributors or domains. This
    discussion paper analyzes three popular formats of ASCII text, PLY, and LAS, for
    supporting LPC and finally proposes a practice to effectively apply HDF5 to facilitate
    the sharing and importing of LPC datasets."
