abstract:
- content: This OGC Engineering Report (ER) documents the results and recommendations
    from a code sprint that was held from 28 to 29 July 2020 to advance the development
    of the draft OGC API – Maps Standard. An Application Programming Interface (API)
    is a standard set of documented and supported functions and procedures that expose
    the capabilities or data of an operating system, application, or service to other
    applications (adapted from ISO/IEC TR 13066-2:2016). The OGC API - Maps Sprint
    was an online virtual event. The sprint was sponsored by Ordnance Survey.
