abstract:
- content: "This is the second Engineering Report (ER) about the Map Markup Language
    (MapML) cite:[Rushforth2018] resulting from OGC Testbed initiatives. To find an
    introduction of MapML and how it works, please, refer to the previous ER OGC 17-019
    cite:[Maso2018]. MapML is a new media type that can be included in a <layer> element
    of a <map> section, in a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page. This document
    is mainly focused on the description of the MapML media type and its evolutions.
    In particular, it considers issues about the Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
    types in MapML, feature and properties encoding, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
    symbolization, multidimensional data etc.\r\n\r\nThis document describes two implementations
    done in OGC Testbed-14: a Cloud-based Proxy (cascade) for MapML done by CubeWerx
    and a ServiceWorker Proxy for MapML done by George Mason University (GMU).\r\n\r\nFinally,
    this document reviews how the next generation of OGC services can integrate MapML
    files as part of the designing of use cases and discusses how MapML can be used
    by social media.\r\n\r\nThis document proposals increases functionality in MapML
    and makes proposals for increasing the interoperability of the proposed encoding
    with the OGC standards baseline and future generations of OGC standards for maps
    and tiles."
