abstract:
- content: "This standard defines the version 3.0 of a valid GML 3.2.1 geometry encoding
    as defined in Geography Markup Language (GML) simple features profile (with Corrigendum)
    to be used with the GeoXACML 3.0 Core standard.\r\nThe use of this encoding extension
    to GeoXACML 3.0 Core enables the direct use of GML 3.2.1 encoded geometries into
    a GeoXACML 3.0 Policy, an Authorization Decision Request or in an Authorization
    Decisionâ€™s Obligation element. It thereby improves the performance of deriving
    access control decisions, where geometries are involved as existing GML 3.2.1
    geometry encodings must not be transformed to Well Known Text (WKT) as supported
    by GeoXACML 3.0 Core. Furthermore, the use of this encoding extension simplifies
    the implementation of a Policy Enforcement Point as it must not provide the transformation
    functions from GML to WKT and vice versa.\r\nThis encoding extension has its normative
    base in Geography Markup Language (GML) simple features profile (with Corrigendum).\r\n"
