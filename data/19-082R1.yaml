abstract:
- content: "The OGC Vector Tiles Pilot 2: Tile Set Metadata Engineering Report (ER)
    describes a conceptual model for Tile Set Metadata that provides information about
    the intended usage of a Tile Set as well as the origin, security level, tiling
    scheme, layers and feature properties contained within. In this ER, a tile set
    is a series of tiles containing data and following a common tiling scheme.\r\n\r\nThe
    metadata is intended to facilitate retrieval of tile sets and describes the major
    characteristics of tile sets without actually accessing the tiles nor the content
    contained in a tile. Such a process could be time consuming when there are a large
    number of tiles in a tile set.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this ER summarizes the discussions
    about Tile Set Metadata among the VTP2 participants, and draws up conclusions
    and recommendations for future work on the subject.\r\n\r\nFinally, this ER describes
    the Technology Integration Experiments (TIEs) performed to test the prototype
    implementation of the proposed Tile Set Metadata Model on API endpoints, client
    applications, and GeoPackages."
