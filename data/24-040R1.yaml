abstract:
- content: This OGC Testbed 20 Report documents the work performed and the findings
    of the GEOINT Imagery Media for ISR (GIMI) Task. The primary goal of the OGC Testbed
    20 GIMI task was to develop, implement, and validate content that will form the
    basis of a future GIMI Standard, addressing specific standardization issues within
    the context of payload optimization and metadata management. Also, the development
    of the OGC Testbed 20 GIMI Specification necessitates a reliable method to evaluate
    the performance and quality impacts of various design choices. This evaluation
    is critical to determine the most efficient design options for the GIMI implementation,
    especially when comparing it to Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG). Therefore, part
    of the GIMI task was to develop those benchmarks and propose their incorporation
    into the OGC Compliance and Interoperability Test Environment (CITE).
