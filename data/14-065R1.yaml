abstract:
- content: "In many cases geospatial or location data, including data from sensors,
    must be processed before the information can be used effectively. The OGC Web
    Processing Service (WPS) Interface Standard provides a standard interface that
    simplifies the task of making simple or complex computational processing services
    accessible via web services. Such services include well-known processes found
    in GIS software as well as specialized processes for spatio-temporal modeling
    and simulation. While the OGC WPS standard was designed with spatial processing
    in mind, it can also be used to readily insert non-spatial processing tasks into
    a web services environment.\r\n\r\nThe WPS standard provides a robust, interoperable,
    and versatile protocol for process execution on web services. It supports both
    immediate processing for computational tasks that take little time and asynchronous
    processing for more complex and time consuming tasks. Moreover, the WPS standard
    defines a general process model that is designed to provide an interoperable description
    of processing functions. It is intended to support process cataloguing and discovery
    in a distributed environment.\r\n\r\n"
