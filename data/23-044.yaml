abstract:
- content: "Large-scale geospatial analytical computation is critically needed for
    tackling a wide range of sustainability problems, such as climate change, disaster
    management, and food and water security. However, such computation often requires
    high-performance computing (HPC) resources that are not easily accessible or usable
    by geospatial researchers and practitioners from various domains. To address this
    challenge, there is a need for developing and standardizing tools and interfaces
    that can bridge the gap between user frontend and HPC backends and enable effective
    and efficient use of High-Performance Geospatial Computing (HPGC) resources for
    geospatial analytics.\r\n\r\nThis OGC Testbed 19 Engineering Report (ER) presents
    the results of a testbed task that:\r\n\r\n* evaluated previous and current work
    in the application of HPC for geospatial analytics, and\r\n* developed draft standards
    for HPGC resource definitions and processing interfaces.\r\n\r\nThis ER provides
    an overview of the Testbed 19 motivation, objectives, scope, and methodology,
    as well as a summary of the main findings, recommendations, and future work directions.\r\n\r\nCyberGIS-Compute
    is reviewed and used as a reference to develop the HPGC API. “CyberGIS-Compute
    is an open-sourced geospatial middleware framework that provides integrated access
    to high-performance computing (HPC) resources through a Python-based SDK and core
    middleware services.”<<CyberGIS_definition>>  The OGC API - Processes<<api_processes>>
    is adopted as the base API for standardizing and developing the HPGC API. A Python
    client library is developed to demonstrate the process of client generation by
    leveraging the OpenAPI client stub/model automatic generation capability<<openapi_generator>>.
    Typical use cases and scenarios are demonstrated and scripted in Jupyter Notebooks."
