abstract:
- content: "This OGC Engineering Report (ER) provides a summary of the research and
    findings from Phase 2 of the OGC Vector Tiles Pilot (VTP2). The goal of VTP2 was
    to deliver a consistent, interoperable online/offline architecture for vector
    tiles based on feature and tile servers, as well as GeoPackage. All Application
    Programming Interface (API) implementations and service types deployed in the
    pilot were implemented to support the prototype vector tile metadata model and
    filtering language. These were two essential work items of VTP2. The feature and
    tile servers included implementations of the OGC API – Features standard and the
    draft OGC API – Tiles specification. The feature and tile servers provided support
    for a variety of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS). This ER provides an overview
    of each of the components, their implementation decisions and the challenges faced.\r\n\r\nThe
    VTP2 participants intend to use the results of the work in VTP2 to inform the
    development of OGC APIs, GeoPackage, and web service standards to enable consistent
    use both online and offline, particularly in DDIL environments. Such consistent
    use of tiled feature data online and offline will improve interoperability and
    usability of geospatial applications. Therefore, the value of the VTP2 work to
    organizations is expected to be in the efficiencies and productivity that comes
    from greater interoperability and usability."
