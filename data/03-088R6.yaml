abstract:
- content: This document specifies many of the aspects that are, or should be, common
    to all or multiple OGC Web Service (OWS) interface Implementation Specifications.
    These common aspects are primarily some of the parameters and data structures
    used in operation requests and responses. Of course, each such Implementation
    Specification must specify the additional aspects of that interface, including
    specifying all additional parameters and data structures needed in all operation
    requests and responses.
