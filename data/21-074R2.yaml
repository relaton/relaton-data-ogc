abstract:
- content: "Disasters are geographic events and, therefore, geospatial information,
    tools, and applications have the potential to support the management of, and response
    to, disaster scenarios to save lives and limit damage.\r\n\r\nThe use of geospatial
    data varies significantly across disaster and emergency communities, making the
    exploitation of geospatial information across a community more difficult. The
    issue is particularly noticeable when sharing between different organizations
    involved in disaster response.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty can be mitigated by establishing
    the right processes to enable data to be shared smoothly and efficiently within
    a disaster and emergency community. To do this requires the right partnerships,
    policies, standards, architecture, and technologies to be in place before the
    disaster strikes. Having such a set-up will enable the technological and human
    capabilities to quickly find, access, share, integrate, and visualize a range
    of actionable geospatial information, and provide this rapidly to disaster response
    managers and first responders.\r\n\r\nFor over 20 years, the Open Geospatial Consortium
    (OGC) has been working on the challenges of information sharing for emergency
    and disaster planning, management, and response. In Disaster Pilot 23 (DP23) the
    aims were to:\r\n\r\ndevelop flexible, scalable, timely and resilient information
    data workflows to support critical disaster management decisions, enabling stakeholder
    collaboration; and\r\nprovide applications and visualization tools to promote
    the wider understanding of how geospatial data can support emergency and disaster
    communities.\r\nThe Disaster Pilot Provider Guide describes the technical requirements,
    data structures, and operational standards required to implement the data flows
    or tools developed in DP23 and Disaster Pilot 21 (DP21) where participants have
    worked on disaster scenarios relating to the following.\r\n\r\nDroughts\r\nWildland
    Fires\r\nFlooding\r\nLandslides\r\nHealth & Earth Observation Data for Pandemic
    Response\r\nCase Studies have focused on the hazards of drought in Manitoba, Canada;
    wildland fires in the western United States; flooding in the Red River basin,
    Canada; landslides and flooding in Peru; and pandemic response in Louisiana, United
    States. The participants have developed a series of data specific workflows to
    generate either Analysis Ready Datasets (ARD) or Decision Ready Indicators (DRI)
    alongside a number of tools and applications to support data discovery, collection,
    or visualization.\r\n\r\nAnnex A describes the tools and applications developed
    within the Pilots along with technical details and the benefits offered similar
    to the data flows. The Guide finishes with details of future possibilities and
    where the Disaster Pilot initiatives could focus next. Annexes B to E give descriptions
    of the data flows developed, including technical details of input data, processing
    and transformations undertaken, standards applied, and outputs produced with details
    of the aspect of disaster management or response supported, benefits offered,
    and the type of decisions assisted with.\r\n\r\nThe Provider Guide is one of three
    Guides produced within DP23 together with the User Guide and the Operational Capacity
    Guide. While the Guides are separate individual documents, the Provider and User
    Guides work together, mirroring each other in terms of structure. The Operational
    Capacity Guide is a stand-alone document effectively underpinning the other two.\r\n\r\n"
