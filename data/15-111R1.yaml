abstract:
- content: "This OGC Land and Infrastructure Conceptual Model Standard presents the
    implementation-independent concepts supporting land and civil engineering infrastructure
    facilities.  Conceptual model subject areas include facilities, projects, alignment,
    road, rail, survey, land features, land division, and wet infrastructure (storm
    drainage, wastewater, and water distribution systems).  The initial release of
    this standard includes all of these subject areas except wet infrastructure, which
    is anticipated to be released as a future extension. \r\nThis standard assumes
    the reader has a basic understanding of surveying and civil engineering concepts.\r\n"
