abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed-18 Engineering Report (ER) describes the results of the
    Secure, Asynchronous Catalogs Task in the Testbed-18 Catalogs, Filtering, and
    Moving Features (CMF) thread. This task explored the following.\r\n\r\nHow search
    processes that are supported in a classical OGC Catalogue Service for the Web
    (CSW)/ISO 19115 environment can be supported through tailoring of the OGC API-Records
    specification.\r\nHow an asynchronous catalog scenario can be supported in which
    metadata publishers push new data to catalog instances that lead to new or updated
    catalog entries and how subscribers are informed about these updates.\r\nHow Data
    Centric Security (DCS) can be applied in combination with OGC API-Records to allow
    encrypted delivery and access of catalog metadata between communication partners."
