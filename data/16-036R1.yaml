abstract:
- content: "The amount of (geospatial) data collected and transferred is rapidly increasing.
    The purpose of this ER is to describe options and recommendations for the delivery
    of large amounts of data as database delivery. This ER therefore describes and
    evaluates different aspects of this challenge:\r\n\r\nData management: How to
    organize large amounts of data so that it can be efficiently accessed through
    OGC service interfaces?\r\n\r\nEncoding: Transferring large amounts of vector
    data in XML based formats (e.g. GML, O&M) leads to specific challenges as the
    parsing of large XML files is often problematic.\r\n\r\nAvailable implementation:
    Several software packages exist to handle large amounts of geospatial data. We
    will investigate to which these approaches are in-line with OGC standards or how
    standards compliance could be achieved.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation and findings in
    the related Big Data Tile Database Implementation are documented in this ER as
    well. The objective of this ER is to provide recommendations of how the delivery
    of large amounts of raster data as database delivery can be considered within
    OGC specifications and future activities."
