abstract:
- content: This Engineering Report (ER) presents guidance concerning the use of OGC®
    catalog services in the aviation domain. A wide variety of metadata resources
    can be readily published and discovered using the OGC CSW-ebRIM application profile,
    which marries the CSW catalog interface to the OASIS ebXML registry information
    model (ebRIM). However, existing SWIM registries currently under development by
    the FAA and Eurocontrol do not implement any OGC standards. This report explores
    the prospects for enhancing SWIM registries by a) integrating OGC catalog functionality,
    and b) accommodating OGC service descriptions.
