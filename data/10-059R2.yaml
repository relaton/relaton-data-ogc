abstract:
- content: The overall scope of this OWS-7 Engineering Report is to clarify how to
    write and register a WPS profile. WPS profiles enable clients to search and identify
    equivalent WPS-based processes distributed on the web. Therefore, this ER provides
    guidelines for designing WPS Profiles based on WPS interface specification 1.0.0.
