abstract:
- content: The OpenGIS Tracking Service Interface Standard supports a very simple
    functionality allowing a collection of movable objects to be tracked as they move
    and change orientation. The standard addresses the absolute minimum in functionality
    in order to address the need for a simple, robust, and easy-to-implement open
    standard for geospatial tracking.
