abstract:
- content: 'This Engineering Report summarizes two phases of the Open Geospatial Consortium
    (OGCÂ®) Fusion Standards study and of the fusion prototypes developed during the
    OWS-7 Testbed which occurred between the two study phases.  Recommendations from
    the first phase of the study were implemented in OWS-7.  Based upon the results
    of OWS-7, responses to two Requests for Information and a multi-day workshop,
    this report provides a cumulative set of recommendations for advancing fusion
    based on open standards. '
