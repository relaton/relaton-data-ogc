abstract:
- content: "The Earth Observation Exploitation Platform Hackathon 2018 was conducted
    to evaluate the standards based architecture for deploying and executing arbitrary
    applications close to the physical location of the data in heterogeneous cloud
    environments. The Hackathon was very successful in demonstrating both efficiency
    and sustainability of the architecture developed in Testbed-13. Efficient, because
    it was possible to setup the full execution workflow of 128 Sentinel-1 images
    within the 1.5 days of the Hackathon in a multi-vendor environment. Sustainable,
    because the architectural approach provides sufficient flexibility to cater for
    possible extensions and exchange of cloud & container middleware.\r\n\r\nThe Hackathon
    produced a number of suggestions for future work items. These include new tools
    to facilitate the process of Application Package generation to make it even simpler
    for scientists to bring their applications to the market; a more detailed specification
    to further improve the level of interoperability; and a best practice document
    with lots of examples that illustrate the necessary steps to make applications
    available.\r\n\r\nHackathon participants highlighted that such a level of robustness,
    flexibility, and maturity of the application-to-the-cloud architecture has been
    developed in nine months only during Testbed-13. The participants recommend to
    continue interlacing major OGC Innovation Program activities, such as testbeds,
    with short term rapid prototyping initiatives such as hackathons. Almost all participants
    of the Hackathon had been new to the OGC Innovation Program. These participants
    emphasized that the Hackathon provided an outstanding opportunity for newcomers
    to get quickly familiar with the latest standardization efforts and helped tremendously
    in understanding investments and new market opportunities for applications-in-the-cloud."
