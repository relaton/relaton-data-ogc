abstract:
- content: Safe Software explored key aspects and challenges related to building data
    value chains from raw data to ARD and DRI in order to support disaster response
    and climate resilience applications, both in this and previous OGC disaster and
    climate pilots. As discussed in prior pilots, while ARD - Analysis Ready Data
    - was initially developed for EO (earth observation) applications; it can also
    be useful to apply ARD approaches to analytic model results to make these results
    more widely accessible.
