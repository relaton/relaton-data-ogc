abstract:
- content: "The FAA and EUROCONTROL, in conjunction with multiple other international
    partners, are currently in the process of developing the Flight Information Exchange
    Model (FIXM). FIXM is an exchange model capturing Flight and Flow information
    that is globally standardized. The need for FIXM was identified by the International
    Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Air Traffic Management Requirements and Performance
    Panel (ATMRPP) in order to support the exchange of flight information as prescribed
    in Flight and Flow Information for a Collaborative Environment (FF-ICE).\r\n\r\nFIXM
    is the equivalent, for the Flight domain, of Aeronautical Information Exchange
    Model (AIXM) and Weather Information Exchange Model (WXXM), both of which were
    developed in order to achieve global interoperability for, respectively, Aeronautical
    Information Systems (AIS) and Meteorological Information (MET) exchange. FIXM
    is therefore part of a family of technology independent, harmonized and interoperable
    information exchange models designed to cover the information needs of Air Traffic
    Management. Previous OGC IP initiatives developed an architecture that supports
    the exchange of AIXM and WXXM data. This report shall describe the integration
    of Geography Markup Language (GML) profile elements into FIXM, specifically, the
    Feature, Time, Geometries and Units of Measure (UOM), into FIXM version 3.0.1
    and drafts of FIXM 4.0. The purpose of this report is to provide recommendations
    and change requests (CR) on the implementation of GML elements for use by the
    FIXM development community."
