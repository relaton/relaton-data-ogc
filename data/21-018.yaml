abstract:
- content: "One of the primary requirements for the OGC Testbed-17 Features and Geometries
    JSON task is to define an extension or profile of GeoJSON that supports encoding
    spatiotemporal data in Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) other than the GeoJSON
    default of the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) datum, with longitude and latitude
    units of decimal degrees (CRS84).\r\n\r\nThis OGC Testbed 17 (TB17) Engineering
    Report (ER) presents the various alternatives considered for declaring CRS information
    in a Features and Geometries JSON (JSON-FG) file. JSON-FG is an OGC extension
    to GeoJSON that, among other things, adds support of coordinate reference systems
    other than the CRS84 default. One of the alternatives was selected to be the mechanism
    for declaring CRS information in a JSON-FG document and is fully described in
    the “OGC Testbed-17: OGC Features and Geometries JSON Engineering Report” (OGC
    21-017r1).\r\n\r\nThis ER was submitted to the OGC Features and Geometries JSON
    Standards Working Group so that the work in TB17 can inform their task of developing
    and documenting a Features and Geometries JSON standard."
