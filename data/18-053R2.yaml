abstract:
- content: "3D Tiles is designed for streaming and rendering massive 3D geospatial
    content such as Photogrammetry, 3D Buildings, BIM/CAD, Instanced Features, and
    Point Clouds. It defines a hierarchical data structure and a set of tile formats
    which deliver renderable content. 3D Tiles does not define explicit rules for
    visualization of the content; a client may visualize 3D Tiles data however it
    sees fit.\r\n\r\nA 3D Tiles data set, called a tileset, contains any combination
    of tile formats organized into a spatial data structure.\r\n\r\n3D Tiles are declarative,
    extendable, and applicable to various types of 3D data. The following tile formats
    have been specified as part of this document:\r\n\r\nBatched 3D Model\r\nInstanced
    3D Model\r\nPoint Cloud\r\nComposite\r\nThis document also describes 3D Tile Styles,
    a declarative styling specification which may be applied to tilesets.\r\n\r\nThe
    3D Tiles specification for tilesets, associated tile formats, and the associated
    styling specification are open formats that are not dependent on any vendor-specific
    solution, technology, or products."
