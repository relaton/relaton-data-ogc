abstract:
- content: "3D Tiles is designed for streaming and rendering massive 3D geospatial
    content such as Photogrammetry, 3D Buildings, BIM/CAD, Instanced Features, and
    Point Clouds. It defines a hierarchical data structure and a set of tile formats
    which deliver renderable content. 3D Tiles does not define explicit rules for
    visualization of the content; a client may visualize 3D Tiles data however it
    sees fit.\r\n\r\nA 3D Tiles data set, called a tileset, contains 3D data organized
    into a spatial data structure. The primary format for delivering the 3D data is
    glTF 2.0. Additional formats for geospatial tile data are also specified in this
    document. These tile formats include Batched 3D Models, Instanced 3D Models, Point
    Clouds and Composite tiles.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies the following elements
    of a tileset:\r\n\r\nThe core data structures for tilesets\r\nTile formats for
    delivering 3D data\r\nAn implicit representation of tilesets that are organized
    in quadtrees or octrees\r\nMetadata that may be associated to elements of a tileset
    on different levels of granularity\r\nDeclarative styling which may be applied
    to tilesets for their visualization\r\nThe 3D Tiles specification for tilesets,
    associated tile formats, metadata, and the associated styling specification are
    open formats that are not dependent on any vendor-specific solution, technology,
    or products.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the content in this OGC document is a direct
    copy of the content contained at the 1.1 tag of the 3d-tiles repo. No normative
    changes have been made to the content. This OGC document does contain content
    not contained in the 1.1 tag of the 3d-tiles repo.\r\n\r\nCesium has published
    the 3D Tiles 1.1 Reference Card as an approachable and concise guide to learning
    about the main concepts in 3D Tiles, intended to jumpstart developers in adopting
    3D Tiles."
