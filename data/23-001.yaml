abstract:
- content: "“Part 1 — Feature Resources” (this Part) defines resource types and encodings
    for providing metadata about systems and their deployments, as well as the procedures
    and sampling strategies used by these systems. Resource types defined in Part
    1 are modeled on concepts from the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (SOSA/SSN).
    They are all feature types except for the Property resource that is used to describe
    feature properties. Part 1 also defines additional filtering capabilities and
    requirements for the Create/Replace/Delete/Update operations."
