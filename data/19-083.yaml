abstract:
- content: "This Engineering report describes the first phase of the Citizen Science
    (CS) Interoperability Experiment (IE) organized by the EU H2020 WeObserve project
    under the OGC Innovation Program and supported by the four H2020 Citizen Observatories
    projects (SCENT, GROW, LandSense, and GroundTruth 2.0) as well as the EU H2020
    NEXTGEOSS project. The activity covered aspects of data sharing architectures
    for Citizen Science data, data quality, data definitions and user authentication.\r\n\r\nThe
    final aim was to propose solutions on how Citizen Science data could be integrated
    in the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). The solution is necessarily
    a combination of technical and networking components, being the first ones the
    focus of this work. The applications of international geospatial standards in
    current Citizen Science and citizen observatory projects to improve interoperability
    and foster innovation is one of the main tasks in the IE.\r\n\r\nThe main result
    of the activity was to demonstrate that Sensor Observing Services can be used
    for Citizen Science data (as proposed in the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
    Sensor Web Enablement for Citizen Science (SWE4CS) Discussion Paper) by implementing
    SWE4CS in several clients and servers that have been combined to show Citizen
    Science observations. In addition, an authentication server was used to create
    a federation between three projects. This federated approach is part of the proposed
    solution for GEOSS that can be found in the last chapter. Many open issues have
    been identified and are expected to be addressed in the second phase of the experiment,
    including the use of a definitions server."
