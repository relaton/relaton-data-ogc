abstract:
- content: "The OpenGIS® Simple Features Interface Standard (SFS) provides a well-defined
    and common way for applications to store and access feature data in relational
    or object-relational databases, so that the data can be used to support other
    applications through a common feature model, data store and information access
    interface. OpenGIS Simple Features are geospatial features described using vector
    data elements such as points, lines and polygons.  \r\n\r\nPart 1 “Common Architecture
    supplies the common feature model for use by applications that will use the Simple
    Features data stores and access interfaces. \r\n\r\nPart 2 provides a standard
    SQL implementation of the abstract model in Part 1. (Note: The OpenGIS® Simple
    Features Interface Standards for OLE/COM and CORBA are no longer current and are
    not provided here.) \r\n\r\nThe corresponding standard for the Web is the OpenGIS®
    Web Feature Service Interface Standard http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs.\r\n"
