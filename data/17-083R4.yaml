abstract:
- content: 'The OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set and Tile Set Metadata Standard
    defines the rules and requirements for a tile matrix set as a way to index space
    based on a set of regular grids defining a domain (tile matrix) for a limited
    list of scales in a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) as defined in OGC 18-005r5
    Abstract Specification Topic 2: Referencing by Coordinates. This content was initially
    included in the OGC 07-057r7 OpenGIS Web Map Tile Service Implementation Standard
    (WMTS) and was separated out into the OGC 17-083r2 OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix
    Set Standard version 1.0, to support reusability in other data formats of services
    that need a tiling scheme. This document is a revision of the OGC 17-083r2 document
    and the general tile matrix set concept is inherited from it with small additions.
    In a tile matrix set, each tile matrix is divided into regular tiles. In a tile
    matrix set, a tile can be univocally identified by a tile column, a tile row,
    and a tile matrix identifier. The OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set and Tile
    Set Metadata Standard describes a data structure defining the properties of the
    tile matrix set in both Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and in tabular
    form. This document also defines a new data structure, called tile set metadata,
    that can be used to describe a particular set of tiles following a tile matrix
    set. Extensible Markup Language (XML) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encodings
    are described both for tile matrix sets and tile matrix set metadata. It includes
    tile matrix set limits, links to the tile matrix set, details of the original
    data represented by the tile set and a nice point of origin to start exploring
    the tile set. Finally, the document offers practical examples of tile matrix sets
    both for common global projections and for specific regions.'
