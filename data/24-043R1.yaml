abstract:
- content: "The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Climate and Disaster Resilience Pilot
    2024 (CDRP24) was driven by the urgent need for new methods, tools, and systems
    to better understand, predict, and address phenomena such as the intensification
    and changing patterns of typhoons, landslides, flooding, and extreme heat events.\r\n\r\nTo
    meet these needs, the CDRP24 initiative brought together private sector, research,
    and government organizations to develop and prototype new information frameworks,
    data and analytical services, and software tools that can enhance forecasting
    and preparedness. In particular, this pilot addressed critical gaps in Analysis-Ready
    Data (ARD) needed to understand natural hazard risks like landslides and extreme
    heat. It also explored how these gaps can be addressed by applying open standards
    to value-added data flows, ensuring that decision-makers and the broader community
    receive the timely information they need to act—both to improve resilience and
    to mitigate the effects of these hazards.\r\n\r\nGeospatial information and technologies
    are essential for enhancing the climate resilience of communities worldwide. They
    also play a central role in designing and implementing the next generation of
    emergency and disaster management systems. This solutions-oriented pilot explored
    both dimensions, leveraging OGC standards, OGC’s Agile Reference Architecture
    for geospatial systems, and the contributions of OGC’s member organizations.\r\n\r\nThree
    main lessons can be learned from the CDRP24 project:\r\n\r\nSome technical components
    required to assemble workflows that integrate diverse datasets are relatively
    mature and have been proven useful in practice. This is evidenced by their implementation
    in multiple application-specific workflows for tasks such as enhanced typhoon
    monitoring, landslide detection and prediction, and weather event modeling. Solidifying
    the shift to API-based architectures, pervasive throughout the applications developed
    in the CDRP, is vital to this maturation.\r\nThe expectation that model outputs
    will be available as Analysis-Ready Data (ARD), Decision-Ready Indicators (DRI),
    contextualized information, and comprehensible representations to non-technical/geospatial
    specialists has continued to increase. Integrating AI into the geospatial toolkit
    reshapes expectations for communicating analysis and modeling results.\r\nThe
    effective incorporation of contextual and domain-specific knowledge within information
    systems is considered necessary to improve the discoverability of relevant data
    and information. Effective incorporation includes ‘true’ semantic interoperability
    of workflows and interpretability of processes. Multiple methods to integrate
    contextual and domain information are being explored and have been proven as viable
    options, including knowledge graphs, AI generated syntheses of extensive bodies
    of knowledge, and processes for human experts producing documentation."
