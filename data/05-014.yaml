abstract:
- content: This Discussion Paper specifies image coordinate reference system (CRS)
    definitions designed for possible use by WCTS and WCS servers and clients, initially
    in the IH4DS thread of the OWS 2 interoperability initiative. This report specifies
    image CRS definitions suitable for both ungeorectified and georectified images,
    where an ungeorectified image can be georeferenced or not.
