abstract:
- content: This OGC® Encoding Standard defines GeoPackages for exchange and GeoPackage
    SQLite Extensions for direct use of vector geospatial features and / or tile matrix
    sets of earth images and raster maps at various scales. Direct use means the ability
    to access and update data in a native storage format without intermediate format
    translations in an environment (e.g. through an API) that guarantees data model
    and data set integrity and identical access and update results in response to
    identical requests from different client applications. GeoPackages are interoperable
    across all enterprise and personal computing environments, and are particularly
    useful on mobile devices like cell phones and tablets in communications environments
    with limited connectivity and bandwidth.
