abstract:
- content: 'This document provides an overview of the Unified Geo-data Reference Model
    for Law Enforcement and Public Safety (Unified Model). The Unified Model was originally
    developed by the GIS Center for Security (GIS CS), Abu Dhabi Police. The GIS CS
    was initiated based on a UAE Ministry of Interior issued decree to establish GIS
    CS with the core mission: “To geo-enable police services and applications using
    International standards and best practices.” In 2010, the GIS SC initiated a program
    to develop a Standardized GIS Environment (SGA). Part of this effort was to define
    and implement a standard data model for sharing Law Enforcement and Public Safety
    data.'
