abstract:
- content: 'The Web 3D Service is a portrayal service for three-dimensional geodata,
    delivering graphical elements from a given geographical area. In contrast to the
    OGC Web Mapping service (WMS) and the OGC Web terrain service (WTS) 3D scene graphs
    are produced. These scene graphs will be rendered by the client and can interactively
    be explored by the user. The W3DS merges different types (layers) of 3D data in
    one scene graph. '
