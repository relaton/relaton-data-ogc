abstract:
- content: 'This Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Engineering Report (ER) captures
    the requirements, solutions, and implementation experiences of the Vector Tiling
    work package in OGC Testbed-13 [Available at: http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/testbed13].
    This ER describes the evaluation of existing vector tiling solutions. The evaluation
    was used to define a conceptual model that integrates elements from different
    approaches to vector tiling. This is followed by an overview of how the developed
    implementation integrates vector tiles containing World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84),
    European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) and British National Grid
    projection data, standards based tile schemas and moving features. Best practice
    guidelines for the use of Symbology Encoding (SE) and Styled Layer Descriptor
    (SLD) are also provided ensuring the service is optimized for analysis and low-bandwidth
    networks. The report concludes with an investigation on how existing OGC services
    may be extended with the necessary capabilities enabling the full range of geometry
    types and tiling strategies to support vector tiling.'
