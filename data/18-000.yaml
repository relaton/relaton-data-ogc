abstract:
- content: "A GeoPackage [geopackage] is a platform-independent SQLite [sqlite] database
    file that contains GeoPackage data and metadata tables. GeoPackages, as described
    by the GeoPackage Encoding Standard [GPKG1_2] are designed to be extensible, including
    support for additional data types. This document defines the Related Tables Extension
    (RTE) for the GeoPackage Encoding Standard.\r\n\r\nThe RTE defines the rules and
    requirements for creating relationships in a GeoPackage data store between geospatial
    data tables and other tables that contain or reference related content such as
    attributes or media. Geospatial data tables (such as features or tiles tables)
    contain location information and/or geometries. There are many examples of where
    the RTE can be used including relating parcel (land lot) features to pictures
    of that parcel or linking census boundaries to the related demographic census
    data."
