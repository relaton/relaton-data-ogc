abstract:
- content: The subject of this Engineering Report (ER) is a hackathon event that was
    held from 20 to 21 June 2019 to advance the development of OGC Application Programming
    Interface (API) specifications. An API is a standard set of documented and supported
    functions and procedures that expose the capabilities or data of an operating
    system, application or service to other applications (adapted from ISO/IEC TR
    13066-2:2016). The OGC API Hackathon 2019, as the event was called, was hosted
    by Geovation at its hub in London, United Kingdom. The event was sponsored by
    the European Space Agency (ESA) and Ordnance Survey.
