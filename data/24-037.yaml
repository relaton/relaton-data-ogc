abstract:
- content: "The goal of the OGC Testbed-20 GeoDataCube (GDC) initiative was to investigate
    streamlining APIs for GDC access and processing, such as implementations of the
    OGC API — Coverages, OGC API – Processes Standards and the OGC openEO and STAC
    Community Standards. The original hypothesis was to define a draft standard that
    unified aspects of these standards. However, integrating and co-existing with
    the existing OGC API baseline standards proved more promising than creating a
    new standard. The key enabler is interoperability — the seamless transfer of data
    between API implementations. Usability and integration testing identified gaps
    in input and output mechanisms, with integration tests across five backends (Ecere,
    Eurac Research, CRIM, Ellipsis Drive, MMS) highlighting the need for best practices
    and conversion methods.\r\n\r\nFocusing on access mechanism alignment enhances
    user experience by fostering interoperability, enabling users to integrate and
    switch between different API processing chains. Developers benefit from common
    references, reducing custom solutions and simplifying conversions between protocols
    such as STAC and OGC API — Coverages implementations. Expanding tests to more
    implementations will further enhance API interoperability and support future standardization
    efforts within the GDC ecosystem."
