abstract:
- content: "This document defines an Application Domain Extension (ADE) of CityGML
    for public safety use cases. The ADE has been developed as part of OGCâ€™s Indoor
    Mapping and Modeling Pilot project sponsored by the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST), Communications Technology Laboratory (CTL), Public Safety
    Communications Research (PSCR) Division. The ADE has been developed primarily
    based on reference preplan symbology created by the National Alliance for Public
    Safety GIS (NAPSG) Foundation. NAPSG is a 501 (C) (3) not-for-profit organization
    that was established in 2005 to overcome challenges faced by Federal, tribal,
    state, and local public safety agencies in the United States. NAPSG focuses on
    using GIS technology to resolve challenges that occur. In the definition of the
    ADE, public safety requirements that were not explicit in NAPSG have also been
    considered. This Engineering Report (ER) provides the methodology of the ADE development,
    details the implementation of the ADE and its structure and the application of
    the ADE in the context of public safety use cases.\r\n\r\nThe findings include:\r\n\r\nA
    methodology to transform NAPSG symbology to data elements;\r\n\r\nA need for an
    extension of a reference to four existing CityGML classes; and\r\n\r\nThe creation
    of seven new CityGML classes that are critical for public safety use cases."
