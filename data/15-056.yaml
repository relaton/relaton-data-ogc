abstract:
- content: 'This OGC Testbed 11 Engineering Report provides a comprehensive review
    and comparison in terms of architecture, functionality, and usability of the OGC
    catalogue service standards CSW 2.0.2 and CSW 3.0. We are especially interested
    in how well the two standards provide support for open searches and federated
    distributed searches in current distributed computing paradigms. We also evaluated
    the support of semantic searches using different strategies, including (1) semantic
    mediation, a.k.a. ontology-based query expansion (Li et al. 2008; Li et al. 2011),
    (2) semantic association, which enables current catalogue information models to
    support semantic search (Li et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015), and (3) complete renovation
    of the CSW information model to be a triple store and utilize Semantic Web technology
    (Berner-Lee 2001) to support semantic query and data retrieval. Scenarios to search
    for hydrological data are developed to evaluate the performance of catalogue searching
    using the above strategies. Recommendations for adoption of CSW standards as well
    as tasks in advancing catalogue search and data discovery in future testbeds is
    also discussed. '
