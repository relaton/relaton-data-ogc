abstract:
- content: "The OGC service metadata document (sometimes also called capabilities
    document) is a key part in the service discovery. It describes the service and
    also the resources that the service expose. Resources are listed in the service
    metadata document inside a section named as Contents by OWS Common. There are
    two main limitations to the current Contents section approach:\r\n\r\nOWS Common
    offers flexibility for describing resources and it only proposes a very minimum
    set of metadata in figure 7 of OGC 06-121r9 called DatasetSummary that need to
    be sub-classed (i.e. extended) by any specific application. As a result, each
    standard proposes its own alternative for it. Integrated client developers need
    to implement them separately.\r\n\r\nIf the number of resources is very large
    or the service is highly dynamic, the Contents section can be too long or useless
    and neither the service nor the client can handle it efficiently.\r\n\r\nThis
    Engineering Report proposes a double solution to the Contents section of the service
    metadata documents: It proposes ways to encode the Contents section using the
    OWS Context encoding data types and it introduces the use OpenSearch as a way
    to request a subset of the resources that the service can provide access to. In
    that sense, the use of the OGC 10-032r8 OpenSearchGeo can provide the long time
    needed geospatial and temporal filter capabilities."
