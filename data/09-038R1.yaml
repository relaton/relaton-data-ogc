    Web Feature Service. Two types of validation are supported:\r\n•\tXML Schema validation
    against the GML application schema\r\n•\tValidation of additional constraints
    encoded in Schematron\r\nThis report describes the validation tool, the types
    of constraints that have been tested and documents the results.\r\n"
