abstract:
- content: 'This document is an abstract test suite (ATS): a compendium of abstract
    test cases pertaining to implementations of the CSW-ebRIM 1.0 catalogue profile.
    It provides a basis for developing an executable test suite (ETS) to verify that
    the implementation under test (IUT) conforms to all relevant functional specifications.
    While passing all of the conformance tests defined in this ATS provides some assurance
    of overall functional correctness, it cannot guarantee that an implementation
    is faultless.'
