abstract:
- content: "GeoSciML is a model of geological features commonly described and portrayed
    in geological maps, cross sections, geological reports and databases.  The model
    was developed by the IUGS CGI (Commission for the Management and Application of
    Geoscience Information) and version 4.1 is the first version officially submitted
    as an OGC standard.  This specification describes a logical model and GML/XML
    encoding rules for the exchange of geological map data, geological time scales,
    boreholes, and metadata for laboratory analyses.  It includes a Lite model, used
    for simple map-based applications; a basic model, aligned on INSPIRE, for basic
    data exchange; and an extended model to address more complex scenarios.  \r\n\r\nThe
    specification also provides patterns, profiles (most notably of Observations and
    Measurements - ISO19156), and best practices to deal with common geoscience use
    cases. \r\n\r\n"
