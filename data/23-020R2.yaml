abstract:
- content: "The OGC Climate Resilience Pilot marked the beginning of a series of enduring
    climate initiatives with the primary goal of evaluating the value chain encompassing
    raw data to climate information processes within Climate Resilience Information
    Systems. This includes the transformation of geospatial data into meaningful knowledge
    for various stakeholders, including decision-makers, scientists, policymakers,
    data providers, software developers, service providers, and emergency managers.
    The results of the OGC Climate Resilience Pilot support the location community
    to develop more powerful visualization and communication tools to accurately address
    ongoing climate threats such as heat, drought, floods, and wild-fires as well
    as supporting governments in meeting commitments for their climate strategies.
    This will be accomplished through evolving geospatial data, technologies, and
    other capabilities into valuable information for decision-makers, scientists,
    policymakers, data providers, software developers, and service providers so they
    can make valuable, informed decisions to improve climate action. One of the most
    significant challenges so far has been converting the outputs of global and regional
    climate models into specific impacts and risks at the local level. The climate
    science community has adopted standards and there are now numerous climate resilience
    information systems available online, allowing experts to exchange and compare
    data effectively. However, professionals outside the weather and climate domain,
    such as planners and GIS analysts working for agencies dealing with climate change
    impacts, have limited familiarity with and capacity to utilize climate data.\r\n\r\n"
