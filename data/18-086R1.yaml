- content: "This OGC Engineering Report (ER) provides the summary findings resulting
    from completion of the OGC Vector Tiles Pilot (VTP or Pilot). The requirements
    for the Pilot were generated from a combination of sponsor input and analysis
    of typical use cases for tiling of vector feature data across the OGC Standards
    Baseline and related standards. The driving use case for this activity was the
    visualization of feature data on a client. The three main scenarios considered
    were consumption of tiled feature data by a web client, a desktop client and a
    mobile client. As a standards body, the OGC already has standards that fit these
    use cases. These are; Web Map Tile Service 1.0 (WMTS) for a web client, and GeoPackage
    1.2 for a mobile client. Web Feature Service (WFS) 3.0 is suitable for a desktop
    client and has an in-built method to support tiling, but not specifically for
    tiled feature data such as that explored in the VTP. One of the purposes of the
    Pilot was to produce demonstration implementations to support tiled feature data
    using WFS 3.0, WMTS 1.0 and GeoPackage 1.2 that can be validated by Technology
    Integration Experiments (TIEs). The draft extension to these standards helped
    define a draft Conceptual Model for tiled feature data in support of visualization.
    The Conceptual Model formally captures the requirements for component implementations
    and rationalizes them into a model documented in the Unified Modeling Language
    (UML).\r\n\r\nThe ER provides an overview of each of the components, their implementation
    decisions and the challenges faced. The components are presented as draft extensions
    to existing standards. The WFS standard is currently in a major revision cycle
    and is transitioning away from services to a resource-oriented architecture. This
    transition has implications for access to tiled feature data. This offers options
    of access to pre-rendered tiles, or to tiles created using WFS 3.0 query functionality.
    The current WMTS standard only offers access to the pre-rendered tiles and much
    of the work is therefore about defining and supporting tiled feature data as a
    media type. The OGC GeoPackage standard is more complex as it attempts to ship
    all of the tiled feature data in a self-contained package aimed at environments
    that have Denied, Degraded, Intermittent or Limited (DDIL) bandwidth. DDIL is
    an important use case for GeoPackage as most normal web services do not function
    without connectivity. The military, first responders and other groups who work
    in challenging operational environments require a capability to ship, store and
    distribute geospatial data in an efficient, modern manner. The combination of
    GeoPackage and tiled feature data offers the means to supply detailed geospatial
    data in a portable fashion to satisfy many DDIL use cases. GeoPackage also offers
    the majority of the future work as it attempts to store information such as styling
    and attribution separately to the geometries to take advantage of a relational
    database structure.\r\n\r\nWhen this project was initiated, the term vector tiles
    was used throughout. However, as the project progressed, the participants agreed
    that the term tiled feature data was more appropriate than the colloquial term
    of vector tiles. This engineering report therefore interchangeably uses both tiled
    feature data and vector tiles to refer to the approach of tiling vector feature
    data.\r\n\r\n"
