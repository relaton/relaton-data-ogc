abstract:
- content: This OGC Testbed-16 Engineering Report (ER) documents the needs and key
    requirements for drafting an OGC Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) Application
    Programming Interface (API) standard. The draft DGGS API is defined using the
    OpenAPI 3.0 specification. The work documented in this ER represents the beginning
    of a multi-initiative process to fully realize the benefits of standards compliant
    DGGS implementations and to help drive adoption of DGGS as a key element in advanced
    Spatial Data Architectures. The Testbed participants investigated a Client-Server
    DGGS architecture involving one (or more) DGGS Server implementations, DGGS-enabled
    Data Sources and a simple front-end DGGS Client. DGGS API functionality will be
    tested using one (or more) simple use case scenarios focusing on the two-way translation
    between geographic locations and DGGS Zonal Identifiers.
