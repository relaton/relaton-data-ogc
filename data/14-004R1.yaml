abstract:
- content: This OGC document defines an OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS) 2.0 hydrology
    profile for SOS 2.0 implementations serving OGC WaterML 2.0. The development of
    this OGC Best Practice (BP) is based on previous activities and results (i.e.
    Hydrology Interoperability Experiments[1] as well as the European FP7 project
    GEOWOW[2]). The work is guided by the need to overcome semantic issues between
    different SOS instances serving hydrological data and the related client applications.
    Therefore, this profile focuses on how to use the entities and requests of the
    standards and defines the necessary technical details to implement the hydrology
    SOS profile.
