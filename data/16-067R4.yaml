abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 12 Engineering Report (ER) discusses the topic of implementing
    vector tiles in an OGC GeoPackage. This report builds on the general topic of
    vector tiling discussed in OGC Testbed 12 Engineering Report [OGC 16-068r4].\r\n\r\nSince
    its public release in 2012, OGC GeoPackage has been getting increasingly popular
    within the geospatial industry for a variety of use cases, such as a means to
    package geospatial data for use on a mobile device and as a means to exchange
    geospatial data between two systems.\r\n\r\nThe OGC GeoPackage standard currently
    specifies requirements (rules) for storing raster tiles and vector (simple) features.
    This Engineering Report proposes an extension to the supported data types by introducing
    an implementation for vector tiles.\r\n\r\nWhile tiling and the use of multiple
    levels of details are a proven technique for accessing and visualizing raster
    data, it is less commonly applied for vector data. This is due to the increased
    complexity compared to raster tiling and lack of standardization on the topic.
    Yet, implementing vector tiles can provide the same benefits as for using raster
    tiles.\r\n\r\nServices can easily cache tiles and return them instantly upon request,
    without the need for any additional pre/post processing. Consequently, clients
    can get tiles very fast, ensuring fast and responsive maps.\r\n\r\nUsing tiled,
    multileveled data representations, clients can always access the data most suitable
    for their current map location and scale. This avoids the need to load too much
    data, which can cause excessive memory usage and reduce overall performance.\r\n\r\nThe
    goal is to enable systems to use OGC GeoPackage as a means to store and access
    vector tiles in an efficient way, similar to raster tiles.\r\n\r\n"
