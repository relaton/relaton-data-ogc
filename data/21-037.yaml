abstract:
- content: Data about buildings and building structures play roles at scales from
    neighborhoods to nations in creating, protecting, regulating, and understanding
    the built environment. This report examines standards which may be useful in defining
    the structure and content of building data at a national scale, a national building
    layer. Standard models, schemas, and encodings may be especially useful for supporting
    an extensible building dataset with an efficient core definition, but the ability
    to encompass more detailed or specialized data as needed in as seamless and compatible
    a manner as possible. Standards compiled and described in this document range
    from generic geographic data encodings to models and specifications for specific
    building perspectives such as land parcel improvements, facility ownership, footprint
    / roofline extractions, residency affordances, envelope characteristics, and so
    on. They provide potential source material for a modular and multi-platform building
    layer definition which can be applied to a reasonably wide set of use cases. This
    definition may in turn be a standardization candidate for adoption by other national
    geographic data collections.
