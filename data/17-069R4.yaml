abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the behavior of Web APIs that provide access to
    features in a dataset in a manner independent of the underlying data store. This
    standard defines discovery and query operations.\r\n\r\nDiscovery operations enable
    clients to interrogate the API, including the API definition and metadata about
    the feature collections provided by the API, to determine the capabilities of
    the API and retrieve information about available distributions of the dataset.\r\n\r\nQuery
    operations enable clients to retrieve features from the underlying data store
    based upon simple selection criteria, defined by the client."
