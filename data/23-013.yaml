abstract:
- content: OGC APIs provide Web based capabilities which are typically based on polling
    for collection resource updates (new features/records items, coverages, maps,
    etc.). Depending on a collectionâ€™s temporal resolution or frequency of updates,
    an event-driven / Publish-Subscribe architecture provides a timely, efficient,
    and low latency approach for delivery of data updates. This paper provides recommendations
    on applying Publish-Subscribe architectural patterns to OGC APIs.
