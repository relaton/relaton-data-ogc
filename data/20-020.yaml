abstract:
- content: "This Testbed-16 Aviation Engineering Report (ER) summarizes the implementations,
    findings and recommendations that emerged from the efforts of further advancing
    interoperability and usage of Linked Data within the Federal Aviation Administration
    (FAA) System Wide Information Management (SWIM) context. The goal of this effort
    was to experiment with OpenAPI and Linked Data to explore new ways for locating
    and retrieving SWIM data in order to enable consumers to consume SWIM data more
    easily in their business applications, and enable the discovery of additional
    relevant information for their needs.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this ER documents the
    possibility of querying and accessing data (and its metadata) using Semantic Web
    Technologies as well as interlinking heterogeneous semantic data sources available
    on the Web. Together with an analysis on the potential for using OpenAPI-based
    Application Programming Interface (API) definitions to simplify access to geospatial
    information, an exploration of solutions for data distribution that complement
    those currently used by SWIM is presented."
