abstract:
- content: "This report summarizes the results of OGC’s Climatology-Hydrology Information
    Sharing Pilot, Phase 1 (CHISP-1). The objective of this initiative was to develop
    an inter-disciplinary, inter-agency and international virtual observatory system
    for water resources information from observations in the U.S. and Canada, building
    on current networks and capabilities.\r\nThe CHISP-1 Initiative was designed to
    support these Use Case functions:\r\n•\tHydrologic modeling for historical and
    current stream flow and groundwater conditions\r\n•\tModeling and assessment of
    nutrient load into the Great Lakes\r\n"
