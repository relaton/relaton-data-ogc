abstract:
- content: "The objective of the Fit for Purpose (FFP) effort in Testbed 13 was to
    develop and test filters and encodings in a platform that can ease the work of
    end-users, especially those who are not expert in dealing with geospatial data
    and satellite imagery. The platform was demonstrated in a scenario that showed
    how these filters can enable information exchange for humanitarian relief and
    analysis of mass movement of populations.\r\n\r\nThis section provides a summary
    of the interoperability tools and practices used by Testbed 13 participants in
    this platform. It includes descriptions and testing results of filters and encodings
    to help simplify access to satellite imagery. This technology was tested in a
    scenario that showed how OGC-based services, encodings, filters and applications
    can help coordinate humanitarian relief activities among nations and organizations."
