abstract:
- content: This OGC Testbed-16 Engineering Report (ER) describes all results and experiences
    from the “Earth Observation Application Packages with Jupyter Notebook” thread
    of OGC Testbed-16. The aim of this thread was to extend the Earth Observation
    Applications architecture developed in OGC Testbeds 13, 14, and 15 with support
    for shared and remotely executed Jupyter Notebooks. The Notebooks make use of
    the Data Access and Processing API (DAPA) developed in the Testbed-16 Data Access
    and Processing API (DAPA) for Geospatial Data task and tested in joint Technology
    Integration Experiments.
