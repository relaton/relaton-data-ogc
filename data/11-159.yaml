abstract:
- content: "EarthCube aims to create an integrated system to access, analyze and share
    information that is\r\nused by the entire geosciences community. The Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) is an\r\norganization of which more than four hundred companies
    and agencies are members, whose\r\npurpose is to create open source standards
    for sharing geospatial and observational information.\r\nThe authors of this paper
    are users of OGC standards in our work in hydrology, meteorology,\r\nclimatology,
    oceanography and in the solid earth sciences, in other words, in key disciplinary\r\nfields
    that contribute to the Geosciences. Moreover, the OGC has an effective process
    for\r\nengaging individuals from many countries in standards development and interoperability
    testing\r\nthat encourages them to set aside the roles they play in their home
    organizations and instead\r\nfocus just on what is needed to share a particular
    class of information across the globe. This\r\npaper examines the hypothesis that
    an OGC-like process could be useful for broader sharing of\r\ninformation in the
    geosciences."
