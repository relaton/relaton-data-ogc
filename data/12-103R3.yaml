abstract:
- content: "The OWS-9 Cross Community Interoperability (CCI) thread built on progress
    made in the recent OWS-8 initiative by improving interoperability between communities
    sharing geospatial data through advances in semantic mediation approaches for
    data discovery, access and use of heterogeneous data models and heterogeneous
    metadata models. This OGC engineering report aims to present findings from CCI
    thread activities towards advancement of semantic mediation involving heterogeneous
    data models, gazetteers and aviation data available through web services conformant
    to OGC standards.\r\nThis Engineering Report was prepared as a deliverable for
    the OGC Web Services, Phase 9 (OWS-9) initiative of the OGC Interoperability Program.
    The document presents the work completed with respect to the Cross Community Interoperability
    thread within OWS-9.\r\n"
