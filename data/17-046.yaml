abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 13 Engineering Report (ER) documents the overall architecture
    developed in the Interoperability of 3D Tiles and I3S using a 3D Portrayal Service
    and performance study of 3D tiling algorithms activity. The report also summarizes
    a proof-of-concept of the use of 3D Tiles and I3S as data delivery formats for
    the OGC 3D Portrayal Service interface standard. The report captures the results
    from the interoperability tests performed as part of the 3D Tiles and I3S testbed
    work package. Specifically, this OGC Testbed activity focused on the following
    tasks:\r\n\r\nCityGML files converted into Cesium 3D Tiles using Analytical Graphics
    (AGI’s) 3D Tiling Pipeline, and Cesium as the rendering client;\r\n\r\nAn OGC
    CDB data store converted into 3D Tiles using Compusult’s Streaming engine, Cesium
    and Ecere’s GNOSIS as rendering client;\r\n\r\nCityGML data store GeoRocket, 3DPS
    with 3D Tiles as data delivery format, and Cesium as rendering client;\r\n\r\nCityGML
    converted into I3S, 3DPS with I3S as data delivery format, and Cesium as rendering
    client;\r\n\r\nCityGML converted into I3S using ArcGIS and FME, 3DPS with I3S
    as data delivery format, and rendering in ArcGIS client;\r\n\r\nCityGML with application
    domain extension stored in GeoRocket, converted to 3D Tiles, and Cesium as the
    rendering client;\r\n\r\n3D Tiles (generated by all streaming engines visualized)
    from Ecere’s GNOSIS rendering client;\r\n\r\nCDB visualized directly from Ecere’s
    GNOSIS rendering client; and\r\n\r\nI3S visualized from Ecere’s GNOSIS rendering
    client.\r\n\r\n"
