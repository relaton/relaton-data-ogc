abstract:
- content: "This Standard provides an updated version of WKT representation of coordinate
    reference systems that follows the provisions of ISO 19111:2007 and ISO 19111-2:2009.
    It extends the earlier WKT to allow for the description of coordinate operations.
    This International Standard defines the structure and content of well-known text
    strings. It does not prescribe how implementations should read or write these
    strings.\r\nThe jointly developed draft has also been submitted by ISO TC211 for
    publication as an International Standard document. The version incorporates comments
    made during both the OGC Public Comment Period as well as the ISO ballot for DIS
    (ISO TC211 document N3750). \r\n"
