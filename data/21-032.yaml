abstract:
- content: "The subject of this Engineering Report (ER) is the evaluation of Cloud
    Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) and Zarr data container implementations. The ER aims to:\r\n\r\n
    Describe the use cases adopted for the evaluation (with existing implementation
    and with Testbed-17 implementation);\r\n Identify the opportunity of proposing
    that COG and Zarr become OGC standards;\r\n Describe all components developed
    during the Testbed; and\r\n Provide an executive summary and a description of
    recommended future work items."
