abstract:
- content: "OGC® Catalogue Services support the ability to publish and search collections
    of\r\ndescriptive information (metadata records) for geospatial data, services,
    and related\r\ninformation. Metadata in catalogues represent resource characteristics
    that can be queried\r\nand presented for evaluation and further processing by
    both humans and software.\r\nCatalogue services are required to support the discovery
    and binding to registered\r\ninformation resources within an information community.\r\nThis
    part of the Catalogue Services standard describes the common architecture for
    OGC\r\nCatalogue Services. This document abstractly specifies the interfaces between
    clients and\r\ncatalogue services, through the presentation of abstract models.
    This common\r\narchitecture is Distributed Computing Platform neutral and uses
    UML notation. Separate\r\n(Part) documents specify the protocol bindings for these
    Catalogue services, which build\r\nupon this document, for the HTTP (or CSW) and
    OpenSearch protocol bindings.\r\nAn Abstract Conformance Test Suite is not included
    in this document. Such Suites shall\r\nbe developed by protocol bindings and Application
    Profiles (see 8.5, ISO/IEC TR 10000-\r\n2:1998) that realize the conformance classes
    listed herein. An application profile\r\nconsists of a set of metadata elements,
    policies, and guidelines defined for a particular\r\napplication1.\r\nOGC document
    number 14-014r3 – HTTP Protocol Binding – Abstract Test Suite is\r\navailable
    to address conformance with the provisions of OGC document number 12-\r\n176r7
    – HTTP Protocol Binding. All annexes to this document are informative."
