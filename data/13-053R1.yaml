abstract:
- content: "This document provides a technical description of the work completed for
    the Climatology-Hydrology Information Sharing Pilot, Phase 1 project. \r\nThis
    document describes a profile of SOS, the NRCan GIN SOS 2.0 profile, developed
    in order to define a baseline of interoperability among the sensor observation
    services used in the project.\r\nThis document describes the use cases used to
    drive the component development during the project.  The first use case was a
    flood scenario that involved exchanging cross-border hydrologic data with a unified
    alert service.  The second use case involved calculating nutrient loads to the
    Great Lakes, which also involved the cross-border exchange of analytic data.\r\nThis
    document describes each component developed during the project and the challenges
    encountered and overcome during the development.  The newly developed components
    include a nutrient load calculation client, a SOS integrating water quality data
    form the U.S. and Canada, a nutrient load calculation service, an upstream gauge
    service, a subscription client, and an event notification service composed of
    a number of sub-components including a subscription broker, an observation harvester
    and a CAP alert client.\r\n"
