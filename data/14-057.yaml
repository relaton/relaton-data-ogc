abstract:
- content: The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the UK Ordnance Survey, AGI and Dstl
    conducted a first of a series of events called the United Kingdom Interoperability
    Assessment Plugfest (UKIAP) 2014. The purpose of UKIAP 2014 is to advance the
    interoperability of geospatial products and services based on OGC standards within
    the UK geospatial information (GI) community.  The results of the Plugfest will
    allow Ordnance Survey to provide best practice guidance to those who want to consume
    or implement geospatial web services or products based on OGC standards.  UKIAP
    2014 is open to open- and closed source vendors and to all GI organizations in
    the UK to involve as many participants in the initiative as possible.
