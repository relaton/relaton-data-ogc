abstract:
- content: "Implementations of the Analysis Ready Data (ARD) concept are consistent
    with the FAIR principles of finding, accessing, interoperating, and reusing physical,
    social, and applied science data with ease. The goal of this Testbed 19 OGC Engineering
    Report (ER) is to advance the provision of geospatial information by creating,
    developing, identifying, and implementing ARD definitions and capabilities. Specifically,
    this ER aims to increase the ease of use of ARD through improved backend standardization
    and varied application scenarios. Additionally, this work seeks to inform ARD
    implementers and users about standards and workflows to enhance the capabilities
    and operations of ARD. Ultimately, the goal of the work described in this ER is
    to maximize ARD capabilities and operations and contribute to the enhancement
    of geospatial information provision.\r\n\r\nFour distinct scenarios – gentrification,
    synthetic data, coverage analysis, and coastal studies – are explored to reveal
    both the strengths and limitations of the current ARD framework. The gentrification
    scenario, which utilizes existing Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS)
    ARD data, highlights the need to expand ARD’s scope beyond Earth Observation (EO)
    data. The integration of diverse data types, such as building footprints and socio-economic
    statistics, is crucial for comprehensive analysis. The synthetic data scenario
    explores the potential of simulated EO imagery to enhance data availability and
    diversity for machine learning applications. However, challenges in standardization
    and quality assessment require further investigation. The analysis of coverages
    for ARD reveals the importance of clear pixel interpretation (“pixel-is-point”
    vs. “pixel-is-area”) and standardized units of measure for seamless integration
    and analysis. Additionally, enriching the metadata structure with defined extensions
    is crucial for efficient data discovery and understanding. The coastal study scenario,
    where in-situ data needs to be elevated to ARD, emphasizes the need for flexible
    levels of readiness. Different analytical tasks may require distinct data properties,
    necessitating adaptable standards that cater to temporal emphasis, spatial alignment,
    and non-GIS applications like machine learning.\r\n\r\nThis work identified several
    key areas for improvement:\r\n\r\nencompassing non-EO data such as building footprints,
    socio-economic statistics, synthetic data, and in-situ measurements;\r\nestablishing
    guidelines and quality controls for incorporating diverse data types;\r\ntailoring
    data specifications to accommodate different analytical needs, including temporal
    emphasis and non-GIS applications; and\r\nimplementing structured metadata with
    defined extensions for enhanced data discovery, understanding, and provenance
    tracking.\r\nIn addition to the above recommendations, the interoperability and
    support of ARD in wider communities warrants further exploration and implementation.
    Additionally, areas such as uniform evaluation and compliance certification could
    be further investigated to ensure consistency in data readiness across various
    hierarchies and application domains."
