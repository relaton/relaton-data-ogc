abstract:
- content: This engineering report documents experiments conducted by CRIM in OGCâ€™s
    Earth Observation Applications Pilot project, sponsored by the European Space
    Agency (ESA) and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), with support from Telespazio
    VEGA UK. Remote sensing, machine learning and climate informatics applications
    were reused, adapted and matured in a common architecture. These applications
    were deployed in a number of interoperable data and processing platforms hosted
    in three Canadian provinces, in Europe and in the United States.
