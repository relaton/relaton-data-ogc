abstract:
- content: This OGC Discussion Paper presents a proposal that recommends the development
    of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards that define a framework for location-based
    service metrics that inform the spatial, spectral, and temporal errors associated
    with various data sources. This paper discusses current industry practices on
    spatial errors, spectral errors, and error propagation. The paper also presents
    a proposed framework and a recommended study effort.
