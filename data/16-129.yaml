abstract:
- content: This discussion paper describes a data model for the standardized exchange
    of citizen science sampling data. To do that it applies the Sensor Web Enablement
    (SWE) to Citizen Science (SWE4CS). In particular, exposes how Observations and
    Measurements (O&M) can be used to model the data of the Citizen Science project,
    in a way that can be retrieved using Sensor Observing System (SOS).This discussion
    paper is a result of the research project Citizen Observatory Web (COBWEB). COBWEB
    is supported by the European Commission through grant agreement 308513
