abstract:
- content: "Testbed 10 ontology work focused on:\r\n•\tA general examination of ontologies
    in the context of OGC data modeling, handling, and organization. Testbed-10 has
    started to define a consistent set of ontologies implementing solid theoretical
    foundations and semantics. \r\n•\tThe definition of a core ontologies for representing
    incident information used by Incident Management Systems (IMS) and mapping symbologies
    used in the emergency and disaster management domain with the goal to improve
    interoperability between different IMS symbology sets used across multi-level
    jurisdiction. \r\n•\tAddressed ontology mapping between hydrology feature models
    using SPARQL and OWL2.\r\n"
