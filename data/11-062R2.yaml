abstract:
- content: The OWS-8 Cross Community Interoperability (CCI) thread was built on progress
    made in the recent OWS-7 initiative to cover key technology areas that could not
    be addressed within the scope of that initiative. The OWS-8 CCI thread aimed to
    increase interoperability within communities sharing geospatial data, including
    advancing of interoperability among heterogeneous data models, advancing strategies
    to share styles to provide a more common and automated use of symbology, improvement
    of KML, and advancing schema automation allowing communities to better share their
    information artifacts. This OGC engineering report aims to present findings from
    the portrayal registries as part of the CCI subthread
