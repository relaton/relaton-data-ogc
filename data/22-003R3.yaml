abstract:
- content: 'Moving feature data can represent various phenomena, including vehicles,
    people, animals, weather patterns, etc. The OGC API — Moving Features Standard
    defines a standard interface for querying and accessing geospatial data that changes
    over time, such as the location and attributes of moving objects like vehicles,
    vessels, or pedestrians. The API specified in this Standard provides a way to
    manage data representing moving features, which can be helpful for applications
    in domains such as transportation management, disaster response, and environmental
    monitoring. This Standard also specifies operations for filtering, sorting, and
    aggregating moving feature data based on location, time, and other properties.
    The OGC API — Moving Features — Part 1: Core Standard specifies a set of RESTful
    interfaces and data formats for querying and updating moving feature data over
    the web. The Standard is part of the OGC API family of Standards and makes use
    of the OpenAPI Specification. OGC API Standards define modular API building blocks
    that spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. OpenAPI is used to define
    the reusable API building blocks with responses in JSON and HTML.'
