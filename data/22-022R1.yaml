abstract:
- content: "The OGC SensorThings API Extension: STAplus 1.0 Standard specifies a backwards-compatible
    extension to the OGC Standard SensorThings API Part 1: Sensing and Sensing 1.1
    data model.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for specifying this STAplus extension is based
    on requirements from the Citizen Science community.\r\n\r\nThe dominant use for
    the OGC SensorThings API data model and API can be coined with the use case “single
    authority provides sensor readings to consumers.” However, in Citizen Science
    there are many contributors (citizens) who – together – create the big picture
    with their observations.\r\n\r\nThe STAplus extension is designed to support a
    model in which observations are owned by different users. This results in requirements
    for the ownership concept. In addition to the ownership, users may express a license
    for ensuring proper re-use of their observations. The STAplus extension also supports
    expressing explicit relations between observations as well as between observations
    and external resources. Relations can enrich observations to enable future extensions
    supporting Linked Data, RDF and SPARQL. Observation group(s) allow the grouping
    of observations that belong together.\r\n\r\nThe STAplus extension is believed
    to be an important contribution towards the realization of the FAIR principles
    as STAplus strengthens the “I” (Interoperability) through a common data model
    and API as well as the “R” (Re-usability) by allowing expressing standards-based
    queries that may consider licensing conditions which is relevant for reuse of
    other users’ observations.\r\n\r\nThe STAplus Data Model and Business Logic also
    enriches existing deployments as the extension can be seamlessly added and thereby
    offers new capabilities to create and manage the “big picture” with multi-user
    capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe key work for crafting this OGC Standard was undertaken
    in the Co-designed Citizen Observatories Services for the EOS-Cloud (Cos4Cloud)
    project, which received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research
    and innovation program and the Enhancing Citizen Observatories for healthy, sustainable,
    resilient and inclusive cities (CitiObs) project, which received funding from
    the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation program. Testing of
    this extension was done with data from the Framework biodiversity project, which
    received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation
    program."
