abstract:
- content: experiment demonstrated that GML content can be embedded in NIEM conformant
    XML and  be exploited by commercial and open source tools without loss of precision
    (e.g., right number of bits) or accuracy (e.g., physical location on a map). Embedding
    GML in NIEM conformant XML was accomplished in MOGIE using the NIEM adapter.
