abstract:
- content: "This Security Engineering Report (ER) covers several OGC Testbed-14 topics:\r\n\r\nBest
    practices for the integration of OAuth2.0/OpenID Connect services\r\n\r\nMediation
    services for different security environments\r\n\r\nFederated identity management\r\n\r\nSecuritization
    of workflows\r\n\r\nThe first two topics are the main focus of this ER. During
    this Testbed, a server that provides OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect capabilities
    was extended with a mediation service that allows for a centralized security authority
    with users/clients that implement different security standards.\r\n\r\nThe remaining
    two topics will expand on the close relationship between Security, Workflows and
    Federated Clouds and the respective implementation challenges. On these specific
    topics, this ER also outlines and provides a proof-of-concept for a simplistic
    architecture approach that explores one of several Federated Clouds architectures."
