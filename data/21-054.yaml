abstract:
- content: "This Disaster Pilot JSON-LD Structured Data Engineering Report documents
    the analysis, discussions, results, and recommendations that emerge from the efforts
    carried out regarding the use of JSON-LD with OGC APIs to generate structured
    web page data for search engine optimization of disaster related information.\r\n\r\nThis
    ER provides the practical experience and lessons learned on the usage of Linked
    Data within OGC APIs with the objective of enhancing the web search and finding
    up-to-date conditions, observations, and predictions associated with well-known
    local geography. Upcoming initiatives should use the findings documented in this
    ER to further develop applications that make geospatial data and information more
    easily findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, which will increase
    the efficiency of disaster response. This ER could also be used as a case study
    of Linked Data to help other industries understand its value and implement it
    within their domains, or it could serve as a baseline for adding Linked Data support
    to one or several OGC API standards."
