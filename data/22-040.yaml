abstract:
- content: Hydrologic geospatial data products contain geometries that represent features
    such as river segments and incremental catchments. The combination of these provides
    a 2D (XY) geospatial fabric (hydrofabic) that discretizes the landscape and flow
    network into hydrologically relevant features at a defined level of scale, resolution,
    or organization. Hydrofabrics have been created at the national and continental
    scale in many parts of the world. This engineering report presents progress on
    formalizing a hydrofabric for drainage basins that adheres to HY_Features concepts
    with a focus on the use of the concepts in modeling hydrologic processes. Furthermore,
    this report documents efforts to integrate river corridor data with the traditionally
    2D hydrofabric representations. River corridors include the channel and adjacent
    land required to maintain or restore a dynamic geomorphic equilibrium.
