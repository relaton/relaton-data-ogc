abstract:
- content: This Engineering Report documents the draft specification for a three-dimensional
    (3D) geodata Application Programming Interface (API) that organizes access to
    a variety of 2D / 3D datasets and their distributions according to a nested hierarchy
    of 3D geospatial volumes (GeoVolumes). The GeoVolumes (initially Tiles-3D / 3D
    Container) API specification is consistent with OGC API - Common and supports
    both link-follow and bbox query methods of access to resources of interest.
