abstract:
- content: "The OGC has extended its suite of Standards to include Resource Oriented
    Architectures and Web APIs. In the course of developing these Standards, some
    practices proved to be common across multiple OGC Web API Standards. These common
    practices are documented in the OGC API — Common Standard. The OGC API - Common
    Standard is a multi-part standard that specifies reusable building-blocks that
    can be used in the construction of OGC API Standards. This document presents Part
    1, the Core, of the OGC API – Common Standard. Standards developers will use these
    building-blocks in the construction of other OGC Standards that relate to Web
    APIs. The result is a modular suite of coherent API standards which can be adapted
    by a system designer for the unique requirements of their system.\r\n\r\nThe purpose
    of the OGC API — Common — Part 1: Core Standard (API-Core) is to define those
    fundamental building blocks and requirements which are applicable to all OGC Web
    API Standards."
