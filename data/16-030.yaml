abstract:
- content: Testbed 12 work evaluates the interoperability of the Common Map API tool
    with commercial vendor tools supporting GeoPackage. Ideally data can be shared
    and exchanged between apps on a single device via GeoPackage. The demonstration
    will show the vector and/or routing data being used by disparate applications.
