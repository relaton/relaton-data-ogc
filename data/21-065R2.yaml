abstract:
- content: "A fundamental operation performed on a collection of features is that
    of filtering in order to obtain a subset of the data which contains feature instances
    that satisfy some filtering criteria. This document specifies\r\n\r\nA filter
    grammar called Common Query Language (CQL2);\r\n\r\nTwo encodings for CQL2 - a
    text and a JSON encoding.\r\n\r\nThe Common Query Language (CQL2) defined in this
    document is a generic filter grammar that can be used to specify how resource
    instances in a source collection of any item type, including features, can be
    filtered to identify a results set. Typically, CQL2 is used in query operations
    to identify the subset of resources, such as features, that should be included
    in a response document. However, CQL2 can also be used in other operations, such
    as updates, to identify the subset of resources that should be affected by an
    operation.\r\n\r\nEach resource instance in the source collection is evaluated
    against a filtering expression. The filter expression always evaluates to true,
    false or null. If the expression evaluates to true, the resource instance satisfies
    the expression and is marked as being in the result set. If the overall filter
    expression evaluates to false or null, the data instance is not in the result
    set. Thus, the net effect of evaluating a filter expression is a set of resources
    that satisfy the predicates in the expression.\r\n\r\nThe Common Query Language
    and its text encoding are not new, but this is the first time that the language
    is formally specified. The Common Query Language with the acronym CQL was originally
    created as a text encoding for use with implementations of the OGC Catalogue Service
    Implementation Specification. The language is based on the capabilities in the
    OGC Filter Encoding Standard, which was originally part of the Web Feature Service
    (WFS) Standard.\r\n\r\nThe Common Query Language as specified in this document
    is a revision of this earlier version. While the language design including the
    classification of operators are consistent with the earlier specification, there
    have been a number of changes and existing implementations of CQL will need to
    be updated to process filter expressions specified by this document. This document
    therefore uses the acronym CQL2 to refer to the current version of the Common
    Query Language."
