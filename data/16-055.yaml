abstract:
- content: "This Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) document provides an analysis of
    the prototype implementations, approaches and performance aspects of data size
    reduction and compression techniques explored in OGC Testbed 12. Specifically,
    it describes work done during Testbed 12 investigating compression for geospatial
    data sets on OGC Web Feature Service (WFS) using W3C Efficient XML Interchange
    (EXI) Format 1.0 (Second Edition).\r\n\r\nThe investigation focused on extending
    WFS with EXI output formats, and the associated performance aspects of data size
    reduction and compression techniques. EXI is a compact representation for the
    Extensible Markup Language (XML) Information Set. EXI is intended to simultaneously
    optimize performance and the utilization of computational resources. From a practical
    viewpoint, EXI is designed to reduce the size of XML data exchanged between computer
    systems.\r\n\r\nEXI uses a grammar-driven approach designed to achieve efficient
    encodings using an encoding algorithm and a small set of datatype representations.
    Consequently, EXI processors are described by the W3C as â€˜relatively simpleâ€™
    and â€˜can be implemented on devices with limited capacity.â€™ An EXI processor
    is used by application programs to encode their structured data into EXI streams
    and/or to decode EXI to make the structured data accessible."
