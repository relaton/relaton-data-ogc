abstract:
- content: "This document introduces an extension to the OGC SensorThings data model
    and discusses\r\nthe best practices for using such an extension in the context
    of Citizen Science.\r\nThe motivation for the introduced extension, referred to
    as “STAplus,” has been developed\r\nduring the EC H2020 project Cos4Cloud and
    is based on requirements from Citizen Science.\r\nWhereas the dominant use of
    the OGC SensorThings data model (and API) can be coined\r\nwith the use case “single
    authority provides sensor readings to consumers”, in Citizen\r\nScience there
    are many contributors (citizens) that – together – create the big “picture” with\r\ntheir
    observations.\r\nThe introduced extension STAplus supports the model that those
    observations are owned by\r\n(different) users that may express the license for
    re-use; we call this part of the contribution\r\nthe ownership concept. In addition
    to the ownership and license abilities, the introduced\r\nextension allows to
    express explicit relations between observations and to create group(s) of\r\nobservations
    to containerize observations that belong together. Relations can be created\r\namong
    any individual observations or observations of a group to support performant Linked\r\nData
    extraction and semantic queries, e.g., expressed in SPARQL.\r\nWe believe that
    the introduced extension is an important contribution towards the realization\r\nof
    the FAIR principles, perhaps not only in Citizen Science, as STAplus strengthens
    the “I”\r\n(Interoperability) through a common data model and API as well as the
    “R” (Reusability) by\r\nallowing to express standards-based queries that may consider
    licensing conditions, relevant\r\nfor reuse of other users’ observations. The
    STAplus Data Model and Business Logic also\r\nenriches existing deployments as
    the extension can be seamlessly added and thereby offer\r\nnew capabilities to
    create and manage the “big picture” with multi-user capabilities.\r\nThis document
    also illustrates best practices of using STAplus, evaluated with proof-ofconcept
    deployments based on the implementations by 52°North, Secure Dimensions, and\r\nCREAF."
