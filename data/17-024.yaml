abstract:
- content: "The Testbed-13 Earth Observation Clouds (EOC) effort supports the development
    of ESA’s Thematic Exploitation Platforms (TEP) by exercising envisioned workflows
    for data integration and processing that are deployed in multiple clouds. The
    Application Deployment & Execution Service OGC Engineering Report (ER) identifies
    the Application Programming Interface (API) for delivering all functionality provided
    to realize the testbed scenario.\r\n\r\nThis ER will list the requirements fulfilled
    by Cloud APIs in order to allow an automation of the application package deployment
    and execution workflow and capture implementation process experiences.\r\n\r\n"
