abstract:
- content: 'Most of current OGC specifications define synchronous communication patterns,
    i.e. after sending a request to an OGC service, clients need to wait for the response.
    But several applications, e.g. delivery of information about events or executing
    complex environmental models with long runtime, need asynchronous client-server
    interaction pattern that do not require clients to keep the connection to the
    server continuously open in order to wait for responses. At the moment, there
    are several approaches how to add asynchronous communication to existing OGC services:
    One option is to use a WPS fa√ßade, as the WPS specification already defines asynchronous
    service responses. Another option is to add extensions to the different specifications
    and the third option is developed by the OGC Publish-Subscribe Working Group.
    This ER summarizes and compares the results from the different activities for
    asynchronous service responses and provides recommendations for future activities.'
