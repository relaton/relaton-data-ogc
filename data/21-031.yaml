- content: "This OGC Best Practice provides readers with guidance on how to use the
    Unified Modeling Language (UML) within the scope of OGC work. Recently there has
    been a move to a resource-based approach for OGC Application Programming Interface
    (API) definition through the OpenAPI Specification and away from the service-based
    approach specified in OGC Web Service (OWS) standards. Previously, the interface
    definitions were almost exclusively XML based, therefore models described using
    UML class diagrams and conceptual models in general simply mapped 1:1 to derive
    the XML schema. Using API resources has resulted in the possibility of deriving
    multiple target technologies from a single standard and therefore, UML model.
    An additional point of discussion within the OGC is the value added by conceptual
    modeling using UML. Models included in OGC Standards vary from diagrams only,
    to conceptual models and model fragments all the way through to Model Driven Architecture
    (MDA) where UML models are used to directly derive implementable artifacts such
    as schemas.\r\n\r\nUML has been the main modeling language of choice within the
    OGC, although up until now, there has been little guidance within the OGC on appropriate
    use of UML. These Best Practices do not seek to govern the use of UML within the
    OGC as it is recognized that UML is a flexible language that has applications
    beyond the current OGC doctrine. However, the practices seek to provide guidance
    to assist in adherence to the following principles:\r\n\r\n Correctness — Adherence
    to the Object Management Group (OMG) UML standard.\r\n Consistency — UML artifacts
    should be consistent across OGC Standards and with supporting standards such as
    those specified by ISO/TC 211.\r\n FAIRness — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable
    and Reusable models.\r\n Value — Any modeling done, UML or otherwise, should add
    value to the parent standard. That is, the modeling should do work for the community
    that is not done elsewhere.\r\nThe Practices are as follows:\r\n\r\n Practice
    1: UML models should follow the OMG UML 2.5.1 Standard ratified in 2017.\r\n Practice
    2: OGC Conceptual Models should be represented as UML Class diagrams.\r\n Practice
    3: OGC Conceptual Models should be platform independent.\r\n Practice 4: OGC Conceptual
    Models should use concepts consistently across standards.\r\n Practice 5: OGC
    Standards should contain a UML model at least at the conceptual level of detail.\r\n
    Practice 6: UML models in OGC Standards should add value.\r\n Practice 7: UML
    models should describe structure in the engineering process.\r\n Practice 8: Modeling
    artifacts should be provided in full.\r\n Practice 9: UML models should at least
    be consistent with supporting text, but ideally normative.\r\n Practice 10: UML
    tooling should produce interoperable artifacts.\r\n Practice 11: UML can be used
    for modeling semantics, although there are other technologies that are more appropriate.\r\n
    Practice 12: OGC UML models should be machine readable (i.e. available in XMI
    format, in addition to the format of the UML Editor used to create the model)."
