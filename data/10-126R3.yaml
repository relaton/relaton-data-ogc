abstract:
- content: "This document is an OGC® Encoding Standard for the representation of hydrological
    observations data with a specific focus on time series structures. WaterML2.0
    is implemented as an application schema of the Geography Markup Language version
    3.2.1, making use of the OGC Observations & Measurements standards.\r\nWaterML2.0
    is designed as an extensible schema to allow encoding of data to be used in a
    variety of exchange scenarios. Example areas of usage are: exchange of data for
    operational hydrological monitoring programs; supporting operation of infrastructure
    (e.g. dams, supply systems); cross-border exchange of observational data; release
    of data for public dissemination; enhancing disaster management through data exchange;
    and exchange in support of national reporting. \r\nThe core aspect of the model
    is in the correct, precise description of time series. Interpretation of time
    series relies on understanding the nature of the process that generated them.
    This standard provides the framework under which time series can be exchanged
    with appropriate metadata to allow correct machine interpretation and thus correct
    use for further analysis. Existing systems should be able to use this model as
    a conceptual 'bridge' between existing schema or systems, allowing consistency
    of the data to maintained.\r\n"
