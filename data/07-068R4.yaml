abstract:
- content: 'This extension of the WCS standard specifies an additional Transaction
    operation that may optionally be implemented by WCS servers. This Transaction
    operation allows clients to add, modify, and delete grid coverages that are available
    from a WCS server. The Transaction operation request references or includes the
    new or modified coverage data, including all needed coverage metadata. '
