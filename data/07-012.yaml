abstract:
- content: As a work item in the OWS4/Conformance and Interoperability Test and Evaluation
    (CITE) project, Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT) provided an open
    source web services compliance engine.  NGIT refers to this engine as the Test
    Evaluation And Measurement (TEAM) Engine.  It executes scripts written in Compliance
    Test Language (CTL), a grammar also developed by NGIT.  This IPR describes TEAM
    Engine in detail and provides information on how it was used in OWS-4/CITE.
