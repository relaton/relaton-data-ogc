abstract:
- content: This Health Spatial Data Infrastructure white paper provides a discussion
    about the collection, exchange, integration, analysis, and visualization of health
    and non-health data to support health applications. Applications that address
    health issues at global and population level scale as well as at the local, individual
    patient scale are presented. The paper identifies opportunities to advance OGC
    Standards towards building a framework to support Health Spatial Data Infrastructures
    (SDIs).
