abstract:
- content: "This OGC® document is an OGC Engineering Report for the “Harmonization
    of SWE Information Models” activity within the OWS-6 SWE thread.\r\nThe document
    discusses relations between OGC standards SensorML, SWE Common and GML and investigates
    solutions for increased synergy between these standards. This activity also created
    UML models of the data types used in SWE and GML.\r\nThis report shows how UncertML
    can be integrated into different SWE encodings, namely SWE Common and Observations
    and Measurements.\r\nThis report further discusses the integration of MathML and
    EML into the SWE environment with an emphasis on SensorML processes and processing.\r\nThis
    document does not discuss the SWE information model related aspects of catalog
    entries for sensor services and discovery. This topic is covered in a separate
    Engineering Report.\r\n"
