abstract:
- content: 'The OGC Testbed-15 Data Centric Security Engineering Report (ER) discusses
    the current state of security in protecting data in a geospatial environment.
    The ER examines the use of encrypted container formats such as NATO STANAG 4778
    Information on standard Metadata Binding with metadata as defined in NATO STANAG
    4774 Confidentiality Metadata Label Syntax in combination with geospatial data
    using the encoding for an OGC Web Feature Service (WFS) FeatureCollection structure.
    This report also makes a recommendation for the creation of new media types to
    support output container formats such as STANAG 4778. The report then discusses
    various implementation scenarios in which a STANAG 4778 (eXtensible Markup Language
    (XML) container maintains encrypted data from author to service to viewer. These
    implementations use the new OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core with features encrypted
    using keys supplied by feature authors and users.'
