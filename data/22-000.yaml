abstract:
- content: "The GeoPose Reviewers Guide is a public resource structured to provide
    quick answers to questions which a reviewer may have about the OGC GeoPose specification.
    This OGC document is provided to support professionals who need to understand
    OGC GeoPose and/or are reviewing the GeoPose draft standard but do not wish to
    implement it.\r\n\r\nGeoPose 1.0 is an OGC Implementation Standard for exchanging
    the position and orientation (Poses) of real or virtual geometric objects within
    reference frames anchored to the Earthâ€™s surface (Geo) or within other astronomical
    coordinate systems. The standard specifies two Basic forms with no configuration
    options for common use cases, an Advanced form with more flexibility for more
    complex applications, and five composite GeoPose structures that support time
    series plus chain and graph structures."
