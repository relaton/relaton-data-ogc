abstract:
- content: "This OGC document proposes one possible solution for the declaration and
    enforcement of access\r\nrestrictions for object-oriented geodata, available through
    a Service-based Geo Data Infrastructure. It is the\r\nintension of the author
    to motivate the requirement for such an access control, give a problem statement,\r\ndiscuss
    an alternative approach and describe the solution, based on GeoXACML."
