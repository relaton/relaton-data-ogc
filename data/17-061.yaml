abstract:
- content: 'The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Application Programming Interface
    (API) assessment was conducted under the OGC Innovation Program with the goal
    to develop an in-depth understanding of all the components necessary to enable
    increased coordination and effectiveness of APIs as applied to geospatial information.  FGDC
    customers have been invited to share their experiences with the use of APIs. From
    those descriptions, recommendations have been derived that help FGDC to better
    understand how APIs are currently being generated and if using a more standardized
    approach to APIs might enable a more robust and optimized service offering. '
