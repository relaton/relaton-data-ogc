abstract:
- content: The Web Notification Service (WNS) is the first asynchronous messaging
    service specified by OGC. At the moment, the WNS message schema is optimized to
    fulfil the needs of services supporting the use of sensors, like Sensor Planning
    Service. Future work activities should include the adaptation of the message schema
    to the needs of other services.
