abstract:
- content: 'The OGC Training Data Markup Language for Artificial Intelligence (TrainingDML-AI)
    Part 3: XML Encoding Standard defines requirements for encoding AI training datasets
    as Extensible Markup Language (XML). XML is a widely utilized format for encoding
    data in various applications. It employs a markup structure where data is enclosed
    in tags represented by opening and closing elements. These elements can have attributes
    and may contain nested elements, allowing for a hierarchical representation of
    structured information. TrainingDML-AI Part 3 is based on the OGC Training Data
    Markup Language for Artificial Intelligence (TrainingDML-AI) Part 1: Conceptual
    Model Standard.'
