abstract:
- content: "Rising sea levels together with increasing storm surges are amongst the
    most challenging issues for coastal communities in the context of global warming.
    The retreating ice sheets of the Circumpolar Arctic are a key contributor to sea
    level rise with consequences felt around the world.\r\n\r\nThe Federated Marine
    Spatial Data Infrastructure (FMSDI) initiative is a key component of OGC and the
    Marine Domain Working Group. The program is designed to engage with stakeholders
    from the marine dataspace to identify opportunities to assist, improve, and scale
    out core business processes complemented by the OGC suite of standards and best
    practices. The FMSDI-2023 pilot represents the fourth phase of the program with
    a focus on the interface between land and sea. A primary goal of this pilot is
    to advance the FMSDI concept to increasing threats posed by climate change.\r\n\r\nThe
    project is divided into three threads, each with application to distinct geographies.\r\n\r\nThread
    1: Digital Twin of Land and Sea Interfaces — Singapore\r\nWith approximately 30%
    of Singapore’s land mass being less than 5m above sea level, the seamless integration
    of land and marine data is integral to Singapore’s focus on coastal protection
    and climate resilience. The management of land and water is separated organizationally
    between the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and the Maritime & Port Authority (MPA),
    respectively. Each agency is responsible for data assets specific to their jurisdiction
    presenting a challenge for cross-organizational concerns. This theme addresses
    the geospatial integration requirements through the development of a multi-dimensional
    Digital Twin of the Singapore coastline.\r\n\r\nThread 2: Digital Arctic Connecting
    Land and Sea — Canada\r\nThis thread addresses the data integration issues in
    the context of Digital Twins for the Canadian Arctic. With the loss of sea ice,
    continuing ocean warming, stronger winds and currents, and accelerated shoreline
    erosion affecting Arctic communities, efficient data usage and analysis is of
    the utmost importance for Canada.\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\nThread 3: Integrating Land
    & Sea for Various Use Cases — Caribbean\r\nThis thread investigates how data developed
    primarily for navigation at sea can be used to better understand the opportunities
    in the Caribbean to support local capacity building and the application of marine
    data in expanded sea-land contexts.\r\n\r\nApproach\r\n\r\nThe FMSDI 2023 pilot
    is managed through the OGC Collaborative Solutions and Innovation (COSI) Program.
    Each thread is a distinct project with a set of participants tackling specific
    use cases and scenarios important to the respective project sponsor.\r\n\r\nWeekly
    project meetings are scheduled to encourage collaboration between the participants
    and sponsors and provide checkpoints to ensure the project scope meets the sponsor’s
    expectations.\r\n\r\nThe FMSDI 2023 pilot also features a series of persistent
    demonstrators as one of its outputs. These demonstrators are workflows and applications
    that stakeholders can access for outreach, testing, and experimentation purposes.
    The demonstrators will be available even after the project is completed and are
    therefore referenced as persistent, but will only be available until December
    2024. These demonstrators showcase how geospatial data can be used in an operational
    context or highlight the gaps in the resources available online, including data
    sources, metadata, access processes, and standards. As each participant has a
    unique solution platform, each has taken different approaches, all of which are
    available for review by stakeholders. Security concerns, such as authentication
    and authorization, are unique to each participant and have been communicated to
    stakeholders and participant contacts. For further details and access to the demonstrators,
    please refer to the link provided.\r\n\r\nCommon across the three threads is the
    application of the OGC FAIR principles — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
    and Reusable. Underpinning the use of the FAIR principles is the role of the core
    OGC Standards and Best Practices. Previous work products related to FMSDI form
    the core information model while the OGC standards, enhanced through the alignment
    and support of industry standards such as the IHO S-100 standard, address many
    of the requirements central to each thread.\r\n\r\nAttention is drawn to the possibility
