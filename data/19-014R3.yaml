abstract:
- content: "This OGC Abstract Specification (AS) defines:\r\n\r\nA conceptual model
    for tiling space in any dimension and;\r\n\r\nA logical model for 2D tiled structures
    and by extension tiling. The logical model is based on the conceptual model.\r\n\r\nThe
    conceptual model specified in this Abstract Specification could be a sub-class
    in a more comprehensive Spatial Partitioning Conceptual Model. Additional Parts
    may be added to this AS for other dimensions, such as 3D, or other uses cases."
