abstract:
- content: This report enhances the understanding of the relationships between application
    schemas based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and ontologies based on the
    Web Ontology Language (OWL). The work documented in this report provides and improves
    tools and principled techniques for the development of Resource Description Framework
    (RDF) based schemas from ISO 19109-conformant application schemas.
