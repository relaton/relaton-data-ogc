abstract:
- content: "The OGC Web Map Service allows a client to overlay map images for display
    served from multiple  Web Map Services on the Internet.  In a similar fashion,
    the OGC Web Feature Service allows a client to retrieve and update geospatial
    data encoded in Geography Markup Language (GML) from multiple Web Feature Services.\r\n\r\nThe
    requirements for a Web Feature Service are:\r\n\r\nThe interfaces must be defined
    in XML.\r\nGML must be used to express features within the interface.\r\nAt a
    minimum a WFS must be able to present features using GML.\r\nThe predicate or
    filter language will be defined in XML and be derived from CQL as defined in the
    OpenGIS Catalogue Interface Implementation Specification.\r\nThe datastore used
    to store geographic features should be opaque to client applications and their
    only view of the data should be through the WFS interface.\r\n The use of a subset
    of XPath expressions for referencing properties.\r\n"
