abstract:
- content: "This OGC® document specifies the Earth Observation Products Extension
    Package for ebXML Registry Information Model 3.0, based on the [OGC 10-157r1]
    Earth Observation Metadata profile of Observations and Measurements.\r\nIt enables
    CSW-ebRIM catalogues to handle a variety of metadata pertaining to earth observation
    p/roducts as defined in [OGC 10-157r1].\r\nThis proposed application profile document
    describes model and encodings required to discover, search and present metadata
    from catalogues of Earth Observation products. The profile presents a minimum
    specification for catalogue interoperability within the EO domain, with extensions
    for specific classes of metadata.\r\n"
