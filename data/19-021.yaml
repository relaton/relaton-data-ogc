abstract:
- content: This OGC Testbed 15 Engineering Report (ER) describes a generalized approach
    towards performing data fusion from multiple heterogeneous geospatial linked data
    sources. The specific use case is semantic enrichment of hydrographic features
    provided by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan). The ER attempts to define and formalize
    the integration pipeline necessary to perform a fusion process for producing semantically
    coherent fused entities.
