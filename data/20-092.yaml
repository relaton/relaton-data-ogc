abstract:
- content: "This Discussion Paper documents the results and recommendations of the
    rapid prototyping activities conducted during the 3D Geospatial Series Tech Sprint
    II - OGC CDB 2.0 (aka CDB X). This activity was performed in support of Special
    Operations Forces (SOF) Future Concepts. This effort hopes to accelerate evolution
    of the OGC CDB standard to meet the needs of planning, rehearsal, and Mission
    Command systems providing decision support to Special Operations Forces and enabling
    SOF tactical and operational advantage. OGC industry standards enable interoperability
    of geospatial data across systems and applications that SOF Operators and analysts
    use across warfighting functions.\r\n\r\nShort summary of CDB X goal: Meeting
    the requirements for tactical GEOINT that can be used across warfighting functions."
