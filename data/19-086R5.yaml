abstract:
- content: "The Environmental Data Retrieval (EDR) Application Programming Interface
    (API) provides a family of lightweight query interfaces to access spatio-temporal
    data resources by requesting data at a Position, within an Area, along a Trajectory
    or through a Corridor. A spatio-temporal data resource is a collection of spatio-temporal
    data that can be sampled using the EDR query pattern geometries. These patterns
    are described in the section describing the Core Requirements Class.\r\n\r\nThe
    goals of the EDR API are to make it easier to access a wide range of data through
    a uniform, well-defined simple Web interface, and to achieve data reduction to
    just the data needed by the user or client while hiding much of the data storage
    complexity. A major use case for the EDR API is to retrieve small subsets from
    large collections of environmental data, such as weather forecasts, though many
    other types of data can be accessed. The important aspect is that the data can
    be unambiguously specified by spatio-temporal coordinates.\r\n\r\nThe EDR API
    query patterns, such as Position, Area, Cube, Trajectory or Corridor, can be thought
    of as discrete sampling geometries, conceptually consistent with the feature of
    interest in the Sensor Observation Service (SOS) standard. A typical EDR data
    resource is a multidimensional dataset that could be accessed via an implementation
    of the Web Coverage Service (WCS) standard. In contrast to SOS and WCS, the EDR
    API implements the technical baseline of the OGC API family of standards and aims
    to provide a single set of simple-to-use query patterns. Use cases for EDR range
    from real or virtual time-series observation retrievals, to sub-setting 4-dimensional
    data cubes along user-supplied sampling geometries. These query patterns do not
    attempt to satisfy the full scope of either SOS or WCS, but provide useful building
    blocks to allow the composition of APIs that satisfy a wide range of geospatial
    data use cases. By defining a small set of query patterns (and no requirement
    to implement all of them), the EDR API should help to simplify the design of systems
    (as they can be performance tuned for the supported queries) making it easier
    to build robust and scalable infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWith the OGC API family of
    standards, the OGC community has extended its suite of standards to include Resource
    Oriented Architectures and Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These
    standards are based on a shared foundation, specified in OGC API-Common, which
    defines the resources and access paths that are supported by all OGC APIs. The
    resources are listed in Table 1. This document extends that foundation to define
    the Environmental Data Retrieval API."
