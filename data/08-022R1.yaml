abstract:
- content: The XML Schema implementation of optional/informative elements of the Observation
    Schema was published in the om/1.0.0/extensions directory, in the same XML namespace
    as the base schema. Those OGC implementations that have a dependency on the Observation
    Schema (i.e. Sampling Features, SOS) <import> the “all-components” document om.xsd.
    However, the all-components stub-schema document “om.xsd” does not include the
    extensions. Thus, any application which requires one of the dependent OGC schemas
    (Sampling Features, SOS) may not access the Observation Schema Extensions, since
    the <import> of om.xsd clashes with any attempt to <import> om_extended.xsd. This
    problem is a consequence of an error in the modularization strategy for optional
    elements, combined with the rules for schema document resolution used by standard
    processing environments.
