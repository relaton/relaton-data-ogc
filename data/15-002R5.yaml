abstract:
  content: The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGCÂ®) provides international standards
    that are implemented worldwide in thousands of applications that use location
    information. To reduce the risk of applications not implementing a standard correctly,
    the OGC provides a compliance process for testing and certifying implementations.
    OGC certification provides substantial evidence that an implementation that is
    claimed to have implemented an OGC standard will interoperate as specified and
    in the same manner as other compliant implementations, regardless of who developed
    them. This white paper provides guidance regarding language to specify requirements
    for OGC compliant and implementing products in software acquisition (procurement)
    documents.
