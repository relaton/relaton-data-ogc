abstract:
- content: "This OGC Engineering Report specifies the results and findings of the
    CityGML Quality\r\nInteroperability Experiment. Guidelines were developed for
    the following concepts:\r\n&#1048576; Definition of data quality;\r\n&#1048576;
    Data quality requirements and their specification;\r\n&#1048576; Quality checking
    process of CityGML data; and\r\n&#1048576; Description of validation results.\r\nThe
    desired outcomes of this Interoperability Experiment are to improve the\r\ninteroperability
    of CityGML data by removing some ambiguities from the current\r\nstandard and
    formally defining data quality requirements for a general CityGML data\r\nspecification.
    Further, the results of this work provides to the community (organizations\r\ninvested
    in capturing, procuring, or utilizing CityGML data) recommended\r\nimplementation
    guidance for 3D data and a suite of essential quality checking tools to\r\ncarry
    out quality assurance on CityGML data."
