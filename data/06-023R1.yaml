- content: "*** Corrigendum - updated 2006-08-08 ***\r\n\r\nThis revised version of
    this document adds additional allowed authority and objectType values, plus specifies
    URNs for data types, as proposed in change requests OGC 05-091r2 and 05-060. In
    addition, corrections have been made to the XML documents listed in Annex A. The
    changes made in this version are tracked in the Microsoft Word (.doc) format of
    this document.<br/><br/>This Best Practices Paper specifies Universal Resource
    Names (URNs) in the ogc URN namespace to be used for identifying definitions.
    This document specifies the formats used by these URNs, plus a set of specific
    URNs for specific definitions. These definitions should be used wherever applicable
    by implementations of various OGC Implementation Specifications, including GML,
    WMS, WFS, and WCS."
