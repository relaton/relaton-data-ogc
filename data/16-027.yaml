abstract:
- content: "This document is a deliverable of the OGC Testbed-12. It describes the
    results of analyzing the Testbed-12 web service implementations.\r\n\r\nOGC has
    been developing web service specifications since the OGC Web Mapping Testbed in
    1999. In particular, the original OGC Web Map Service specification has been developed
    during that testbed. 17 years later most current OGC web service standards still
    follow the general approach that had been developed in 1999 (the capabilities
    document, the remote procedure call via HTTP paradigm, etc).\r\n\r\nOver time,
    the OGC web service approach has been amended and extended in different ways by
    different OGC standards and profiles. In addition, some of the more flexible mechanisms
    have been used in practice in different ways by different software vendors or
    communities. The OGC Web Service Common standard had been a response by OGC to
    these developments and aimed at maintaining a consistent approach across the different
    OGC web service standards. However, this effort has been only partially successful
    for several reasons, including shortcomings in the OWS Common standard, the existence
    of multiple incompatible OWS Common versions and a reluctance by working groups
    and communities to introduce incompatible changes to existing service types in
    order to harmonize. All attempts in recent years to continue the work on OWS Common
    have not seen much traction. While there seems to be general agreement that the
    current situation is not optimal and that consistency is desirable, it is unclear
    how to improve in a way that meets market demands.\r\n\r\nThis document summarizes
    information about the web service implementations in Testbed-12. It is not and
    should not be understood as a general analysis or assessment of the OGC web service
    architecture, but a low-key effort to gain some insights from looking at a significant
    number of web service implementations and their use in interoperability experiments
    and demos.\r\n\r\nDuring the years since 1999 not only the OGC standards baseline
    has evolved, but also the Web itself. The W3C has been working on identifying
    Best Practices for Data on the Web and W3C and OGC are jointly working on extending
    this with Best Practices for Spatial Data on the Web. The analysis also includes
    an assessment about the OGC approach to web services with respect to the draft
    best practices at the time of writing of this report.\r\n\r\nTo the extent possible,
    we draw conclusions and recommendations from the information that has been gathered.
    These fall into three categories:\r\n\r\nImproving the interoperability of OGC
    web services as they are today\r\n\r\nSupport for new requirements in a consistent
    way across service types\r\n\r\nImprovements to the standardization process\r\n\r\nIn
    addition, there is also a specific case that does not fit into these general categories."
