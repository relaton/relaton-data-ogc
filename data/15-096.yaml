abstract:
- content: 'This OGC Discussion Paper provides examples of some actual and potential
    geospatial applications using the OGC Moving Features encoding. These applications
    can be used to define the next steps in the development of the OGC Moving Features
    Standard: The definition of a “Moving Features API”. As a conclusion, the Moving
    Features SWG recommends that a new Moving Features API standard should target
    the following three kinds of operations: retrieval of feature information, operations
    between a trajectory and a geometric object, and operations between two trajectories.
    Additionally, the Moving Features SWG recommends establishing an abstract specification
    for these three kinds of operations because only a part of operations for trajectories
    is defined by ISO 19141:2008 - Schema for moving features.'
