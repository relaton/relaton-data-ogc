abstract:
- content: "This discussion paper contains the material that is still relevant from
    Section 6 (or Appendix A) of the previous version 4 (document OGC 99-107) of OGC
    Abstract Specification Topic 7, titled The Earth Imagery Case. That version of
    Topic 7 has now been superseded by a new version with the same title.\r\nIn addition,
    some terminology has been revised to be consistent with the terminology now used
    in Topic 16: Image Coordinate Transformation Services. Specifically, the previous
    term real-time image geometry model has been changed to approximate image geometry
    model. Also, the previous name Universal Real-Time Image Geometry Model has been
    changed to Universal Image Geometry Model.\r\n"
