abstract:
- content: 'This report presents the results of a concept development study on Disasters
    Interoperability, sponsored by US Geological Survey (USGS) and Federal Geographic
    Data Committee (FGDC), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and executed
    by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The focus of this study was to understand
    how to best support the development of, or combination of SDI(s) for the use in
    disasters, to advance the understanding of stakeholder issues, and serve stakeholdersâ€™
    needs. The study included stakeholder engagements, workshops and open Request
    for Information (RFI) that gathered external international positions and opinions
    on the optimal setup and design of an SDI for disasters. The outflow of this report
    will guide a series of interoperability pilots to address priority challenges
    identified by the community in this study. The report follows the format and document
    of the OGC Arctic Spatial Data Pilot; Phase 1 Report: Spatial Data Sharing for
    the Arctic. '
