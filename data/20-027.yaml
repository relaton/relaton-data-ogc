abstract:
- content: This OGC Testbed 16 Engineering Report (ER) examines all aspects of security
    and trust in federated computing environments as defined in the NIST Cloud Federation
    Reference Architecture [1]. The security and trust requirements are identified.
    Then possible approaches for achieving security and trust are examined. These
    approaches range from traditional methods for securing just the basic communications
    among federated entities to the use of emerging security technologies including
    federated roots of trust, trust frameworks, blockchain, data-centric security,
    and zero trust architectures.
