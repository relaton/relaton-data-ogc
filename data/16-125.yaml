abstract:
- content: This document describes how dense geospatial raster data can be represented
    using the W3C RDF Data Cube (QB) ontology [vocab-data-cube] in concert with other
    popular ontologies including the W3C/OGC Semantic Sensor Network ontology (SSN)
    [vocab-ssn], the W3C/OGC Time ontology (Time) [owl-time], the W3C Simple Knowledge
    Organisation System (SKOS) [skos-reference], W3C PROV-O [prov-o] and the W3C/OGC
    QB4ST [qb4st]. It offers general methods supported by worked examples that focus
    on Earth observation imagery. Current triple stores, as the default database architecture
    for RDF, are not suitable for storing voluminous data like gridded coverages derived
    from Landsat satellite sensors. However we show here how SPARQL queries can be
    served through an OGC Discrete Global Grid System for observational data, coupled
    with a triple store for observational metadata. While the approach may also be
    suitable for other forms of coverage, we leave the application to such data as
    an exercise for the reader.
