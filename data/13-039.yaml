abstract:
- content: "This document provides a specification of an OpenSearch extension for
    Earth Observation Satellites Tasking.\r\n\r\nThis OGC Best Practice is intended
    to provide a very simple way to task Earth Observation (EO) satellites sensors,
    to allow simple syndication between, and to provide a basic federated query of
    related sensors, whereby a single client can query several instances and present
    a collection of future acquisition as one set.\r\n\r\nThis document is the result
    of work undertaken within the European Space Agency (ESA) Heterogeneous Mission
    Accessibility for Science (HMA-S) project funded by ESA the Long Term Data Preservation
    (LTDP) program.\r\n\r\nThe document was initially produced during the ESA HMA
    (Heterogeneous Missions Accessibility) initiative (see ‘Normative References’
    section) related projects."
