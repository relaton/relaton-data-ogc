abstract:
- content: This Discussion Paper is about the use of KML, an encoding used to express
    geographic annotation and visualization on existing or future web-based online
    maps (2d) and earth browsers (3d). KML uses a tag-based structure with nested
    elements and attributes and is based on the XML standard.
