abstract:
- content: "This document is an abstract test suite (ATS): a compendium of abstract
    test cases that provide a basis for verifying the structure and content of OGC
    KML 2.2 instance documents. Three conformance levels are defined; each level builds
    on the preceding ones:\r\n\r\n    *\r\n\r\n      Level 1 - includes test cases
    covering all requirements to be satisfied by a minimally conformant KML document;\r\n
    \   *\r\n\r\n      Level 2 - as for Level 1, plus test cases addressing recommended
    requirements;\r\n    *\r\n\r\n      Level 3 - as for Level 2, plus test cases
    covering suggested constraints that are informative in nature."
