abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report (ER) summarizes the main achievements of the Federated
    Marine Spatial Data Infrastructure (FMSDI) Pilot Phase 3. It focused on a variety
    of aspects contributing to an overarching scenario to aid in the better understanding
    of both the challenges and potential opportunities for coastal communities, ecosystems,
    and economic activities in the Arctic region.\r\n\r\nThe sub-scenarios, i.e.,
    those scenarios developed by each participant, address aspects of the changing
    Arctic landscape. These activities included the following.\r\n\r\nA sea-based,
    health and safety scenario incorporating the land/sea interface in the Arctic.
    This scenario demonstrates the technology and data used with OGC, IHO, and other
    community standards in response to a grounding event and the evacuation of an
    expedition cruise ship or research vessel in the Arctic. Demonstrating interoperability
    between land and marine data that is necessary to aid first responders and other
    stakeholders. This scenario incorporates, but is not be limited to:\r\n\r\nvoyage
    planning information (e.g., Arctic Voyage Planning Guide, Safety of Navigation
    products and services, Maritime Safety Information);\r\n\r\nland-based emergency
    services/resources (e.g., Coast Guard stations, transit times to emergency services
    or ports, medical facilities and resources, helicopter access);\r\n\r\ncoastal
    environmental/topographic/hydrographic/maintenance data (e.g., deposition and
    dredging of seafloor sediment, changes in coastline and bathymetry); and\r\n\r\nglobal
    maritime traffic data in the Arctic (e.g., to help assess likelihood of other
    ships in responding to a ship in distress).\r\n\r\nDemonstrating interoperability
    between land and marine data that is necessary to understand coastal erosion (e.g.,
    ocean currents, geology, permafrost characteristics, etc.).\r\n\r\nGeneral sensitivity
    to climate change."
