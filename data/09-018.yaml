abstract:
- content: "This extension of the WCS standard specifies an Information Community
    data model with the related encoding that may optionally be implemented by WCS
    servers. This extension specification allows clients to evaluate, request and
    use data encoded in CF-netCDF3 format from a WCS server.\r\nThis document is an
    extension of the Web Coverage Service (WCS) 1.1 Corrigendum 2 (version 1.1.2)
    Implementation Standard [OGC 07-067r5]. With small changes, this extension is
    expected to also apply to WCS 1.2. \r\n"
