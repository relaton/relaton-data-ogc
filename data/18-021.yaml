abstract:
- content: "OGC Web Feature Service (WFS) 3.0 is a revision of the WFS standard that
    proposes a modernized service architecture, that follows the current Web architecture,
    has a focus on the developer experience, supports the OpenAPI specification, and
    modularizes WFS into building blocks for fine-grained access to spatial data that
    can be used by an Application Programming Interface (API) for data.\r\n\r\nThis
    document reviews the work that proposes a next generation of OGC web services
    (NextGen services or Next Generation APIs) from the perspective of supporting
    complex three-dimensional (3D) data or complex data schemas. The goal is to identify
    the best service solution for these particular needs, whether the results are
    WFS 3.0 extensions or other approaches. In this context the approach of the NextGen
    services is not of monolithic web services, but Web API building blocks. This
    is an important point. The same API should be able to support requirements that
    currently require separate OGC web services, e.g. a WFS and a 3D Portrayal Service
    (3DPS).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this work is not to preempt other next-generation
    discussions taking place in OGC but rather to inform and complement that work.\r\n\r\nThe
    report includes proposals on how to extend the NextGen service architecture with
    API building blocks for complex data, complex queries and 3D portrayal. WFS 3.0,
    Part 1, is used as the starting point for the NextGen service architecture. The
    proposals are based on existing requirements and use cases as well as existing
    support for developers to simplify implementation.\r\n\r\nThe work has found no
    general issues with migrating current WFS, 3DPS, Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) and
    Web Map Service (WMS) capabilities to the NextGen architecture. On the contrary,
    the NextGen approach improves the consistency of the interface and removes redundancies
    (e.g., between the feature access in WFS and the feature info requests in the
    other standards)."
