abstract:
- content: 'This Engineering Report documents the development effort to build a Web
    Processing Service (WPS) to perform a change detection algorithm on two motion
    video streams.  It will examine the WPS Motion Video Change Detection architecture
    from various viewpoints in order to describe its purpose, data models, functional
    decomposition, and interaction between distinct computational components.  '
