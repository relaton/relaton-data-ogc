abstract:
- content: "This document defines a Gazetteer Service profile of the OGC Web Feature
    Service Standard. The OGC Gazetteer Service allows a client to search and retrieve
    elements of a georeferenced vocabulary of well-known place-names.\r\nThis profile
    extends the WFS interface in a way that a client is able to\r\n–\tDetermine if
    a WFS implementation is acting as a Gazetteer Service. \r\n–\tQuery the Gazetteer
    Service in order to retrieve place-name features without closer examination of
    the feature type definitions\r\n–\tAccess metadata about the gazetteer(s) provided
    by the service\r\n–\tUpdate place-name features using WFS transactions\r\n–\tFetch
    place-name features that have Parent-Child relationships and then follow those
    links\r\n"
