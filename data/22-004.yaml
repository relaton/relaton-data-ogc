abstract:
- content: The subject of this Engineering Report (ER) is a code sprint that was held
    from the 8th to the 10th of March 2022 to advance support of open geospatial standards
    within the developer community, whilst also advancing the standards themselves.
    The code sprint was hosted by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the Apache
    Software Foundation (ASF), and Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). The
    code sprint was sponsored by Ordnance Survey (OS), and held as a completely virtual
    event.
