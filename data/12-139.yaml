abstract:
- content: "In this engineering report we describe how to administrate XACML v2.0,
    XACML v3.0 and GeoXACML v1.0.1 access control policies through a “Security Rules
    Service”. Following the XACML and ISO terminology this service plays the role
    of a Policy Administration Point (PAP) and is therefore called XACML Policy Administration
    Point (XACML PAP) or XACML Policy Administration Web Service (XACML PAWS). \r\nAfter
    introducing OWS-9’s Common Rule Encoding and motivating all components required
    to administrate (Geo)XACML  policies, we describe the interface of a powerful
    XACML PAP on a conceptual level. This interface definition could serve as a baseline
    for a future OASIS or OGC XACML Policy Administration Web Service (e.g. OGC XACML
    PAWS) specification.\r\n"
