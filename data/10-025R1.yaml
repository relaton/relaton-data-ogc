abstract:
- content: "This standard specifies an XML implementation for the OGC and ISO Observations
    and Measurements (O&M) conceptual model (OGC Observations and Measurements v2.0
    also published as ISO/DIS 19156), including a schema for Sampling Features. This
    encoding is an essential dependency for the OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS)
    Interface Standard.\r\nMore specifically, this standard defines XML schemas for
    observations, and for features involved in sampling when making observations.
    These provide document models for the exchange of information describing observation
    acts and their results, both within and between different scientific and technical
    communities."
