abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report (ER) summarizes the demonstrations, findings,
    and recommendations that emerged from the second phase of the OGC Federated Marine
    Spatial Data Infrastructure (FMSDI) Pilot. The goal of this initiative was to
    further advance the interoperability and usage of Marine Protected Area (MPA)
    data through the implementation of the IHO standard S-122 and several OGC API
    standards.\r\n\r\nThis ER describes a solution architecture consisting of a collection
    of interoperable components developed to demonstrate technologies that helped
    to achieve the objectives of this Pilot’s phase. This document describes a server
    built to serve MPA data through an OGC API – Features endpoint and two servers
    that combined MPA data with additional datasets and served it through both an
    OGC API – Features and an OGC API — EDR endpoint. This document also describes
    the three clients built to consume under different scenarios the data offered
    by the aforementioned servers. Finally, this ER captures lessons learned and recommendations
    for IHO and OGC API standards, and recommendations for future work."
