abstract:
- content: "The OGC Testbed-17 Moving Features thread conducted an interoperability
    feasibility study that examined specific scenarios that could be supported by
    a Moving Features Application Programming Interface (API). The use cases considered
    tracking objects based on motion imagery, analytical processing and visualization.
    This Engineering Report presents a specification of a prototype Moving Features
    API, that could serve as the foundation for a future draft OGC API — Moving Features
    standard.\r\n\r\n"
