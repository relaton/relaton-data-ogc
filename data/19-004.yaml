abstract:
- content: This OGC discussion paper provides an extension module of OGC Indoor Geography
    Markup Language (IndoorGML) for the seamless navigation between indoor and outdoor
    spaces. The OGC IndoorGML standard has an issue on the data model that affects
    the connection of indoor and outdoor spaces via an “Anchor Node,” which is a conceptual
    part for connecting indoor and outdoor spaces. This discussion paper aims to show
    use cases of how IndoorGML can connect with other geospatial standards that represent
    outdoor spaces (and road networks), such as OGC City Geography Markup Language
    (CityGML) and version 5.0 of the Geographic Data Files (GDF) format.
