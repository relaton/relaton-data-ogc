abstract:
- content: This document is a revision to the GeoPackage WKT for Coordinate Reference
    Systems Extension that previously was published as Annex F.10 of the GeoPackage
    Encoding Standard 1.3.0 (OGC 12-128r17). This document replaces Annex F.10. The
    extension defines how to encode coordinate reference systems (CRS) in GeoPackages
    using the ISO/OGC Well-known text representation of coordinate reference systems
    [2019] (CRS WKT2) Standard. Specifically, this revision adds coordinate epochs
    to the encoding of coordinate reference systems in a GeoPackage.
