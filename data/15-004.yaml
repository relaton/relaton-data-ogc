abstract:
- content: "The Common DataBase (CDB) Specification provides the means for a single,
    versionable, simulation-rich, synthetic representation of the earth.  A database
    that conforms to this Specification is referred to as a Common DataBase or CDB.
    \ A CDB provides for a synthetic environment repository that is plug-and-play
    interoperable between database authoring workstations.  Moreover, a CDB can be
    used as a common on-line (or runtime) repository from which various simulator
    client-devices can simultaneously retrieve and modify, in real-time, relevant
    information to perform their respective runtime simulation tasks; in this case,
    a CDB is plug-and-play interoperable between CDB-compliant simulators.  A CDB
    can be readily used by existing simulation client-devices (legacy Image Generators,
    Radar simulator, Computer Generated Forces, etc.) through a data publishing process
    that is performed on-demand in real-time.\r\nThe application of CDB to future
    simulator architectures will significantly reduce runtime-source level and algorithmic
    correlation errors, while reducing development, update and configuration management
    timelines.  With the addition of the HLA/FOM and DIS protocols, the application
    of the CDB Specification provides a Common Environment to which inter-connected
    simulators share a common view of the simulated environment.\r\nThe CDB Specification
    is an open format Specification for the storage, access and modification of a
    synthetic environment database.  The Specification defines the data representation,
    organization and storage structure of a worldwide synthetic representation of
    the earth as well as the conventions necessary to support all of the subsystems
    of a full-mission simulator.  The Specification makes use of several commercial
    and simulation data formats endorsed by leaders of the database tools industry.\r\nThe
    CDB synthetic environment is a representation of the natural environment including
    external features such as man-made structures and systems.  It encompasses the
    terrain relief, terrain imagery, three-dimensional (3D) models of natural and
    man-made cultural features, 3D models of dynamic vehicles, the ocean surface,
    and the ocean bottom, including features (both natural and man-made) on the ocean
    floor.  In addition, the synthetic environment includes the specific attributes
    of the synthetic environment data as well as their relationships.\r\nA CDB contains
    datasets organized in layers, tiles and levels-of-detail; together, these datasets
    represent the features of a synthetic environment for the purposes of distributed
    simulation applications.  The organization of the synthetic environmental data
    in a CDB is specifically tailored for real-time applications. \r\n"
