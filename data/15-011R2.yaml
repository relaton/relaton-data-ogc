abstract:
- content: "This document describes the work done in the OGC Testbest-11 to support
    multiple WFS-T instance interoperability by way of a transaction scenario involving
    the interaction between clients and multiple WFS-T servers as well as the interaction
    between the servers themselves, especially in the use case of enterprise-to-enterprise
    data synchronization.\r\nThe document presents an overview of the transaction
    scenario, the components used to implement the scenario in the OGC Testbed-11
    demo and the new capabilities added to the WFS-T server to support the scenario.\r\n"
