abstract:
- content: The emergence of Federated Cloud processing and ‘Big Data’ have raised
    many concerns over the use to which data is being put. This led to new requirements
    for methodologies, and capabilities which can address transparency and trust in
    data provenance in the Cloud. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and more
    specifically blockchains, have been proposed as a possible platform to address
    provenance. This OGC Testbed 15 Engineering Report (ER) is a study of the application
    of DLTs for managing provenance information in Federated Clouds.
