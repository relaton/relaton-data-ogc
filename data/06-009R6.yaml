abstract:
- content: The OpenGIS® Sensor Observation Service Interface Standard (SOS) provides
    an API for managing deployed sensors and retrieving sensor data and specifically
    “observation” data. Whether from in-situ sensors (e.g., water monitoring) or dynamic
    sensors (e.g., satellite imaging), measurements made from sensor systems contribute
    most of the geospatial data by volume used in geospatial systems today. This is
    one of the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) [http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/markets-technologies/swe]
    suite of standards.
