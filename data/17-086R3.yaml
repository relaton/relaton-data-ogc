abstract:
- content: "The purpose of the GetPolygon operation is to extract data contained within
    a polygon defined either by a set of points or the radius and position of a circle
    point. The need for the GetPolygon operation stems from active members of the
    OGC MetOcean Domain Working Group (DWG) who saw a manifest need for extraction
    of such information from gridded datasets.\r\n\r\nThis work has been done by members
    of the OGC MetOcean Domain Working Group."
