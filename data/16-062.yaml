abstract:
- content: "This engineering report has been produced by the OGCÂ® Testbed-12 initiative.\r\nThe
    engineering report evaluates interoperability between a variety of\r\ncatalogues.
    The report presents a comparison of the catalogues, with the same\r\ndatasets
    uploaded. The catalogues discussed in the report include services\r\nconforming
    to Catalogue Service for Web (CSW) version 2.0.2 and 3.0, including\r\nservices
    based on the ebRIM profile of CSW 2.0.2 and an extension of CSW 3.0\r\nwith OpenSearch
    and SOAP. The engineering report presents results from tests\r\nusing a multi-catalogue
    client to interact with each service. The engineering\r\nreport also provides
    a comparison of CSW and services based on the Data\r\nCatalogue (DCAT) specification
    covering functionality, expressiveness and\r\nusability of CSW and DCAT. The comparison
    is supported by a discussion on the\r\nimplementation of a SPARQL / GeoSPARQL
    service."
