abstract:
- content: The Machine Learning (ML) Engineering Report (ER) documents the results
    of the ML thread in OGC Testbed-15. This thread explores the ability of ML to
    interact with and use OGC web standards in the context of natural resources applications.
    The thread includes five scenarios utilizing seven ML models in a solution architecture
    that includes implementations of the OGC Web Processing Service (WPS), Web Feature
    Service (WFS) and Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW) standards. This ER includes
    thorough investigation and documentation of the experiences of the thread participants.
