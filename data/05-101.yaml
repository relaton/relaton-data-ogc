abstract:
- content: In this experiment, the retrieval time of GML features from a Web Feature
    Service (WFS) to a WFS client will be studied by varying certain control parameters
    including methods of encoding and compression. Four different control parameters
    including encoding format, data set size, bandwidth, and feature type will be
    varied to test the relative performance in each case.
