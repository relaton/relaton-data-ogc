abstract:
- content: A Geolinked Data Access Service (GDAS) provides a way to publish and access
    data that refers to spatial features (e.g. population data for countries).  A
    GDAS can expose data from non-GIS databases so that it can be manipulated and
    mapped with the aid of a Geolinking Service.
