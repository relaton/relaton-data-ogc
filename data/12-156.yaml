abstract:
- content: "The Reference Architecture Profiler (RAP) Advisor™ is a web based application
    that\r\nrecommends OGC Standards and OGC Reference Model (ORM) Sections that are\r\nrelevant
    to a system development; such that a community of interest could derive and\r\nbuild
    a profile of suitable OGC standards to meet their specific needs. This Engineering\r\nReport
    contains the requirements, conceptual design, development methodology, and\r\nimplementation
    of the RAP Advisor.\r\nInitial development of the RAP Advisor™ was concurrent
    with the OGC Web Services\r\nTestbed, Phase 9 (OWS-9) with NGA sponsorship. During
    OWS-9 timeframe, key\r\nconcepts of the RAP Advisor were confirmed through prototyping.
    Future development\r\nis required to complete the functions and content of the
    Advisor."
