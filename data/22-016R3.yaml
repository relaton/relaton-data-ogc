abstract:
- content: This OGC Testbed-18 (TB-18) Engineering Report (ER) is based on previous
    OGC Moving Features and Sensor Integration (MFSI) activities. The OGC TB-18 MFSI
    task addressed the interoperability between sensors and between sensing systems
    as well as the exchange of multiple sources of detected moving objects into one
    common analytic client. This ER describes the architecture framework for multi-source
    moving object detection into the client supported by OGC MFSI Standards and describes
    challenges of multi-sensor integration in the context of Moving Features data.
