abstract:
- content: "The OGC’s Testbed 18 initiative explored the following six tasks.\r\n\r\n1.)
    Advanced Interoperability for Building Energy\r\n2.) Secure Asynchronous Catalogs\r\n3.)
    Identifiers for Reproducible Science\r\n4.) Moving Features and Sensor Integration\r\n5.)
    3D+ Data Standards and Streaming\r\n6.) Machine Learning Training Data\r\nTestbed
    18 Task 3, Identifiers for Reproducible Science, explored and developed workflows
    demonstrating best practices at the intersection of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
    and Reusable (or FAIR) data and reproducible science.\r\n\r\nThe workflows developed
    in this Testbed included:\r\n\r\nthe development of a Whole Tail workflow for
    land cover classification (52 Degrees North);\r\nthe development of a reproducible
    workflow for a deep learning application for target detection (Arizona State University);\r\nthe
    implementation of reproducible workflows following the approach described in the
    OGC API Process Part 3: Workflows and Chaining for Modular OGC API Workflows (Ecere);\r\nthe
    development of a reproducible workflow that runs an OGC API — Process and Feature
    Server instance within a Whole Tale environment (GeoLabs); and\r\nthe development
    of a water body detection Application Package to cover the identifier assignment
    and reproducibility from code to several execution scenarios (local, Exploitation
    Platform, Whole Tale) (Terradue).\r\nTestbed 18 participants identified considerations
    and limitations for reproducible workflows and recommendations for future work
    to identify the benefits of reproducible science for healthcare use cases."
