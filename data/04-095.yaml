abstract:
- content: "The OpenGISÂ® Filter Encoding Standard (FES) defines an XML encoding for
    filter expressions. A filter expression logically combines constraints on the\r\nproperties
    of a feature in order to identify a particular subset of features to be operated
    upon.  For example, a subset of features might be identified to render them in
    a particular color or convert them into a user-specified format. Constraints can
    be specified on values of spatial, temporal and scalar properties. An example
    of a filter is: Find all the properties in Omstead County owned by Peter Vretanos.\r\n\r\nThis
    standard is used by a number of OGC Web Services, including the Web Feature Service
    [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs], the Catalogue Service [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat]
    and the Styled Layer Descriptor Standard [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sld].
