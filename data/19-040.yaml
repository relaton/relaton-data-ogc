abstract:
- content: The goal of this OGC WPS Routing API Engineering Report (ER) is to document
    the specification of an Application Programming Interface (API) which supports
    geographic routing. The specification includes two alternative approaches to such
    an API, one based on the current draft of the OGC API - Processes draft specification
    and another based on the OGC API principles (and the OGC API - Common draft specification).
    Both approaches facilitate a common Route Exchange Model.
