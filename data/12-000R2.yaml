abstract:
- content: "The primary focus of the Sensor Model Language (SensorML) is to provide
    a robust and semantically-tied means of defining processes and processing components
    associated with the measurement and post-measurement transformation of observations.
    This includes sensors and actuators as well as computational processes applied
    pre- and post-measurement.\r\n\r\nThe main objective is to enable interoperability,
    first at the syntactic level and later at the semantic level (by using ontologies
    and semantic mediation), so that sensors and processes can be better understood
    by machines, utilized automatically in complex workflows, and easily shared between
    intelligent sensor web nodes.\r\n\r\nThis standard is one of several implementation
    standards produced under OGCâ€™s Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) activity. This standard
    is a revision of content that was previously integrated in the SensorML version
    1.0 standard (OGC 07-000)."
