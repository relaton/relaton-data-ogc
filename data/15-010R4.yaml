abstract:
- content: "This document presents an assessment of the conformance level, with respect
    to the WFS standard (OGC 09-025r2), of the web feature servers used in the OGC
    Testbed-11.  Each server is accessed to determine if it conforms to the minimum
    requirements of the WFS standard.  Each server is further accessed to determine
    whether the server offers additional, upcoming and complimentary capabilities
    just as support for the WFS REST API and GeoJSON.\r\nThis document offers recommendations
    to aid implementers of the WFS standard (OGC 09-025r2).\r\nThis document presents
    options available to WFS implementers for achieving interoperability between WFS
    clients and server at the schemas level.\r\nThis document includes a survey of
    available WFS clients and an assessment of their capabilities.\r\nThis document
    reviews tools and standards, such as the GeoSynchronization Service (OGC 10-069r3),
    that are complimentary components that may be used with a WFS to address requirements
    such as verification and notification, data and access security, exception handling
    and system hardening.\r\nFinally, this document includes a FAQ composed of questions
    raised during the OGC Testbed-11.\r\n"
