abstract:
- content: "Improving the ability of key disaster decision makers and responders to
    discover, manage, access, transform, share, and exploit location-based and Earth
    Observation data will enhance decision making and, hopefully, save lives. The
    OGC Disaster Pilot 2021 has developed a number of prototype capabilities to demonstrate
    solutions for providing consistent, and reliable information to enable real-time
    actions to be taken using multiple technologies working together through pre-agreed
    standards.\r\n\r\nThis User Guide describes how the solution works, how users
    can be part of it, and showcases what can be achieved if everyone is willing to
    work together and share data and knowledge to improve the information available
    to those responding to a disaster."
