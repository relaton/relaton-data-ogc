abstract:
- content: "This document is a deliverable of the OGC Web Services (OWS) Initiative
    - Phase 8 (OWS-8). It describes the results of the conceptual and schematron rule
    based validation of the Digital NOTAM Event Specification (DNES). Various conceptual
    aspects were identified which need clarification and/or revision. Schematron rules
    were developed for a number of the DNES scenarios. This document contains coverage
    tables which document normative statements from the DNES and indicate which of
    them can be tested with existing schematron rules.\r\nSee:  <a href=http://dp.schemas.opengis.net/11-092r2>http://dp.schemas.opengis.net/11-092r2</a>"
