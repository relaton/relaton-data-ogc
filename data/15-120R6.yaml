abstract:
- content: The CDB standard defines a standardized model and structure for a single,
    “versionable,” virtual representation of the earth. A CDB structured data store
    provides for a geospatial content and model definition repository that is plug-and-play
    interoperable between database authoring workstations. Moreover, a CDB structured
    data store can be used as a common online (or runtime) repository from which various
    simulator client-devices can simultaneously retrieve and modify, in real-time,
    relevant information to perform their respective runtime simulation tasks. In
    this case, a CDB is plug-and-play interoperable between CDB-compliant simulators.
    A CDB can be readily used by existing simulation client-devices (legacy Image
    Generators, Radar simulator, Computer Generated Forces, etc.) through a data publishing
    process that is performed on-demand in real-time.
