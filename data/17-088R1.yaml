abstract:
- content: "Disasters are responsible for major socioeconomic damages. Global initiatives
    call for the improvement of information technology infrastructure to better share
    data and advance multinational collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe Strengthening Disaster
    Risk Reduction Across the Americas: A Regional Summit on the Contributions of
    Earth Observations held on September 3-8 in 2017 in Buenos Aires, Argentina strengthened
    the collective ability to share the many challenges of disaster risk reduction
    in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) while promoting the awareness and better
    use of earth observations (EO).\r\n\r\nA simulation exercise took place during
    the summit. The exercise brought together government, emergency managers, earth
    observation data providers, academics, non-governmental organizations, and commercial
    companies. The participants assessed the capabilities and needs of policymakers,
    regional and on-the-ground decision makers, and learned what information products
    can be produced, and when and how such products are available.\r\n\r\nThis ER
    describes the description and results of the simulated scenario including the
    post-exercise activity that captured the lessons learned from the participants.\r\n\r\n"
