abstract:
- content: With a growing requirement to carry out complex analysis in large multi-disciplinary,
    heterogeneous data collections, an approach is required to extract equivalent
    information from dissimilar content. The more information can be normalized, the
    easier it will be to correlate the content. Given that almost all data has a spatio-temporal
    component, this ER will look into the idea of defining a Spatial-Temporal Service
    and analyze which collection of data types, operations and architecture patterns
    would be necessary to spatial-temporal enable any content. This OGCÂ® document
    reviews the General Feature Model and gives guidelines for necessary modifications
    to broaden its scope, so that it can be re-used for non-geospatial centric applications
    and extended as necessary into a general model for all object types.
