abstract:
- content: The Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) Simple profile defines restrictions that
    limit the flexibility in implementing a WMTS instance. Adding additional requirements
    has the goal of simplifying the creation of services and clients. By implementing
    this profile, clients can more easily combine data coming from different services
    including from other WMTS instances and even from some tile implementations that
    are not OGC WMTS based, such as some current distributions of OSM. In fact, most
    of these tiling services are implicitly following most of the WMTS requirements.
    Many current WMTS services that implement this profile will have to undergo some
    changes on how tiles are exposed, and a client that is compatible with WMTS 1.0
    will be immediately compatible with this profile. The aim is to align the WMTS
    standard to other popular tile initiatives which are less flexible but widely
    adopted.
