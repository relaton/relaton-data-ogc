abstract:
- content: "This OGC® Encoding Standard defines GeoPackages for exchange and GeoPackage
    SQLite Extensions for direct use of vector\r\ngeospatial features and / or tile
    matrix sets of earth images and raster maps at various scales. Direct use means
    the ability to access\r\nand update data in a native storage format without intermediate
    format translations in an environment (e.g. through an API) that\r\nguarantees
    data model and data set integrity and identical access and update results in response
    to identical requests from different\r\nclient applications. GeoPackages are interoperable
    across all enterprise and personal computing environments, and are particularly\r\nuseful
    on mobile devices like cell phones and tablets in communications environments
    with limited connectivity and bandwidth."
