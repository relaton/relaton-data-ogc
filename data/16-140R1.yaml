abstract:
- content: This document proposes a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encoding representation
    of movement of geographic features as an encoding extension of OGC Moving Features
    ([OGC 14-083r2] and [OGC 14-084r2]). A moving feature, typically a vehicle and
    pedestrian, can be expressed as a temporal geometry whose location continuously
    changes over time and contains dynamic non-spatial attributes whose values vary
    with time. This Best Practice describes how to share moving feature data based
    on JSON and GeoJSON (a JSON format for encoding geographic data structures). In
    addition, this document provides an example of RESTful approaches as a Feature
    Service Interface that has the potential for simplicity, scalability, and resilience
    with respect to exchange of moving feature data across the Web.
