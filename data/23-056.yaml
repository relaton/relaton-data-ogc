abstract:
- content: Almost every activity in our modern life leaves a digital trace, typically
    including location and time. Either captured by a sensor, manually input, or extracted
    from a social media post, the increase in the volume, variety, and velocity of
    spatiotemporal data is unprecedented. The ability to manage and analyze this data
    is important for many application domains, including smart cities, health, transportation,
    agriculture, sports, biodiversity, et cetera. It is critical to not only effectively
    manage and analyze the data but also to uphold privacy and ethical considerations.
    Since the civilian use of GPS was allowed in 1980, followed by the technological
    advances in other location tracking systems â€“ wifi, RFID, bluetooth, etc., it
    is becoming more and more easy to track moving objects. The Mobility Data Science
    Summit was an opportunity to discuss the challenges of managing this data and
    making sense of it, with a focus on the tooling and standardization requirements.
