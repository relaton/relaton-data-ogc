abstract:
- content: "The Geospatial eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (GeoXACML) 3.0
    defines a geospatial extension to the OASIS eXtensible Access Control Markup Language
    (XACML) Version 3.0 Standard. GeoXACML 3.0 supports the interoperable definition
    of access rights including geographic conditions based on the XACML 3.0 language,
    processing model and policy schema. GeoXACML 3.0 provides improvements based on
    enhancements to the XACML Standard, primarily the support of access conditions
    spanning different XACML categories. This enhancement empowers GeoXACML 3.0 to
    be a powerful decision engine with support for spatiotemporal access conditions.\r\n\r\nAs
    a result of the XACML 3.0 deployment model and corresponding implementation flexibility,
    GeoXACML 3.0 can be operated as a traditional Policy Decision Point or as a cloud-native
    API gateway.\r\n\r\nThe OGC GeoXACML 3.0 Standard defines different conformance
    classes that supports flexible implementation conformance. Implementation of the
    Core conformance class supports the ISO 19125 geometry model including topological
    test (spatial relations) functions which enables the indexing of access conditions-based
    geometry. The Spatial Analysis conformance class extends the topological test
    functions for defining access conditions including the processing of geometries.
    To support condition evaluation for geometries encoded in different Coordinate
    Reference System (CRS), the CRS Transformation conformance class enables a compliant
    implementation to undertake dynamic CRS transformation during decision-making
    unless prohibited per request. Finally, the API conformance class enables operating
    a GeoXACML 3.0 compliant implementation as an OGC API conformant service (Policy
    Decision Point)."
