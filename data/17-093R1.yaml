abstract:
- content: This OGC Engineering Report describes the results of the OGC GeoPackage
    (GPKG) Related Tables Extension Interoperability Experiment (GPKG-RTE IE). This
    IE tested a proposed extension to the OGC GeoPackage Encoding Standard (12-128r14).
    The GPKG-RTE defines the rules and requirements for associating tables with existing
    feature or attribute tables in a GeoPackage data store. As part of this IE, the
    participants performed Technology Integration Experiments (TIEs) where they produced
    GeoPackages that used this extension, loaded them into GPKG-compliant software
    systems, and observed the results. As a result of this work, the IE participants
    agree that the extension is fit for use and consideration as a standard by OGC.
