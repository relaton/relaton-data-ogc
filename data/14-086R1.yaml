abstract:
- content: "This OGC® document summarizes the Aircraft Access to SWIM (AAtS) Harmonization
    activity developed by a team funded by the FAA and led by the Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC). The activity involved assembling a core team of industry participant
    experts to analyze and harmonize four standards suites and/or standards-based
    architectures relevant to air-ground information exchange:\r\n•\tThe Aircraft
    Access to SWIM (AAtS) concept, \r\n•\tRTCA aeronautical information services (AIS)
    and meteorological (MET) information data link service committee’s (SC-206) concepts
    and standards, \r\n•\tAir-Ground Information Exchange A830 (AGIE) standard and
    \r\n•\tOGC standards and architectural perspectives. \r\nElements of this effort
    have included:\r\n•\tCreation and public release of a Request for Information\r\n•\tAnalysis
    of the fits and overlaps between the four standards suites\r\n•\tEngagement with
    ongoing standards development efforts to reduce incompatibilities\r\n"
