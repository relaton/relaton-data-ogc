abstract:
- content: The mission of the OGC Naming Authority (OGC-NA) is to provide the means
    through which OGC resources such as OGC documents, namespaces and ontologies can
    be controlled and managed such that they can provide clear and well-defined names
    and definitions. In the terminology defined in ISO 19135, OGC-NA is the Control
    Body for the register of OGC Names. This document describes the framework of documents,
    registers and other resources required for OGC-NA to execute that role.
