abstract:
- content: "A single I3S data set, referred to as a Scene Layer, is a container for
    arbitrarily large amounts of heterogeneously distributed 3D geographic data.Scene
    Layers are designed to be used in mobile, desktop, and server-based workflows
    and can be accessed over the web or as local files.\r\n\r\nThe delivery format
    and persistence model for Scene Layers, referred to as Indexed 3d Scene Layer
    (I3S) and Scene Layer Package (SLPK) respectively, are specified in detail in
    this OGC Community Standard. Both formats are encoded using JSON and binary ArrayBuffers
    (ECMAScript 2015). I3S is designed to be cloud, web and mobile friendly. I3S is
    based on JSON, REST and modern web standards and is easy to handle, efficiently
    parse and render by Web and Mobile Clients. I3S is designed to stream large 3D
    datasets and is designed for performance and scalability. I3S is designed to support
    3D geospatial content and supports the requisite coordinate reference systems
    and height models in conjunction with a rich set of layer types.\r\n\r\nThe open
    community GitHub version of this standard is here: https://github.com/Esri/i3s-spec
    [2]."
