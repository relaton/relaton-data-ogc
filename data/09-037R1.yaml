abstract:
- content: "This OGC document specifies a CityGML-based application schema for a subset
    of an Urban Topographic Data Store (UTDS) as specified by the US National Geospatial-Intelligence
    Agency (NGA).\r\nThe particular focus of this implementation profile was to test
    the applicability of CityGML to UTDS data. \r\nThis document specifies the implementation
    profile as well as the findings.\r\n"
