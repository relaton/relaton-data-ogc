abstract:
- content: The mission of the OGC Naming Authority (OGC-NA) is to provide the means
    through which OGC resources such as OGC documents, namespaces and ontologies can
    be controlled and managed such that they can provide clear and well-defined names
    and definitions. In the terminology defined in ISO 19135, OGC-NA is the Control
    Body for the register of OGC Names. This document specifies a rule for constructing
    OGC names that may be used for identifying specification elements defined in the
    OGC Specification Model â€“ Modular Specification.
