- content: The Underground Infrastructure Concept Development Study (UICDS) Engineering
    Report [1] examined the present state of underground infrastructure information
    (UGII), costs and benefits of that state, as well as future opportunities for
    an improved state. That report describes a number of candidate models for UGII
    and recommends a number of follow-on activities, including development of a prototype
    UGII integration model to support subsequent UGII integration and exchange initiatives.
    A follow-up workshop and model development effort resulted in another engineering
    report describing an initial (1.0) version of the conceptual UGII integration
    model MUDDI (Model for Underground Data Definition and Interchange) [2]. The present
    updated report describes MUDDI version 1.1. The goal of MUDDI is to serve as the
    basis for integration of datasets from different models, at the levels of detail
    required to address application use cases described in [1]. MUDDI as described
    here is a conceptual model which will serve as the basis for one or more conformant
    and interchangeable logical and physical implementations such as GML (Geographic
    Markup Language) or SFS (Simple Features SQL). The current version 1.1 of MUDDI
    has been updated and refined from the initial version 1.0, but is still intended
    to serve as an input to the proposed OGC Underground Infrastructure Pilot as well
    as similar implementations and deployments in realistic application scenarios.
    The present model is also suitable as input to begin development of a formal conceptual
    model standard.
