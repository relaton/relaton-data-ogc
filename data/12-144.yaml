abstract:
- content: This OGC® Engineering Report provides guidelines for the harvest, registration
    and retrieval of aviation resources from an OGC web catalogue/registry service
    (OGC CSW-ebRIM), with particular emphasis on ISO metadata resources. Alternatives
    for selective and efficient retrieval of such resources are also described along
    with lessons learned. The OGC CSW-ebRIM registry interface is evaluated against
    SESAR registry requirements, documented as a gap analysis, to assess whether there
    are any obstacles to implementing SESAR registry with an OGC CSW-ebRIM interface.
