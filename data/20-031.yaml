abstract:
- content: This Engineering Report summarizes the purpose and key results of the 3D
    Data Container and Tiles API Pilot, an OGC Innovation Program initiative conducted
    between October 2019 and July 2020. In the context of both existing and emerging
    3D and 2D standards, the focus of the Pilot was on the exchange and visualization
    of 3D data using open standards.
