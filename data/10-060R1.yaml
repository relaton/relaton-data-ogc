- content: "This document is applicable to use cases in which event-driven architecture
    principles are applied in Spatial Data Infrastructures.\r\n\r\nThe document specifies
    publish/subscribe functionality for OGC web services. This is done by first defining
    an abstract publish / subscribe model and then deriving functional requirements
    from this model."
