abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed 16 Engineering Report (ER) documents the two major aspects
    of the Testbed 16 OpenAPI Thread. These are:\r\n\r\nA Unified Modeling Language
    (UML) metamodel that describes OpenAPI and a profile of that model to describe
    OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core;\r\n\r\nAn implementation of a transformation
    procedure in the ShapeChange open source software. This procedure was designed
    to transform a UML representation of the OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core model
    into an OpenAPI 3.0 document.\r\n\r\nThe process for creating the model and doing
    the transformation relied upon the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach. MDA
    takes a platform independent model (PIM) and transforms that model into a platform
    specific model (PSM)."
