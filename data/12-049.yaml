abstract:
- content: "This OGC standard specifies parameters to the OGC Web Coverage Service
    (WCS) GetCov-erage request which give control over interpolation of a coverage
    during its server-side pro-cessing. This allows the client (user) to control and
    specify the interpolation mechanism to be applied to a coverage during server
    processing.\r\nThis WCS Interpolation extension relies on WCS Core [OGC 09-110r4]
    and the GML Appli-cation Schema for Coverages [OGC 09-146r2].\r\n"
