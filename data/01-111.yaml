abstract:
- content: ISO 19115 was adopted as a replacement for OGC Abstract Specification Topics
    9 and 11.  In June 2001, a motion to include material in addition to ISO 19115
    was adopted as document 01-111 Metadata AS. The approved addition to document
    01-111 is contained in document 01-053r1, which normatively references parts of
    the old AS Topic 9, document 99-109r1. FGDC in conjunction with ANSI INCITS L1
    are planning the migration of the FGDC Content Standard for Geospatial Metadata
    to be a profile of ISO 19115
