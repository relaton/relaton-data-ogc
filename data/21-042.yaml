abstract:
- content: The subject of this Engineering Report (ER) is a code sprint that was held
    from 26 to 28 May 2021 to advance the development of the OGC API - Maps draft
    standard, OGC API - Tiles draft standard, and the OGC API â€“ Styles draft standard.
    An Application Programming Interface (API) is a standard set of documented and
    supported functions and procedures that expose the capabilities or data of an
    operating system, application or service to other applications (adapted from ISO/IEC
    TR 13066-2:2016). The code sprint was hosted online. The code sprint was sponsored
    by Ordnance Survey (OS) and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan).
