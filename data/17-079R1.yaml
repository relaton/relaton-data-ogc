abstract:
- content: The OGC SensorThings API [OGC 15-078r6] provides an open, geospatial-enabled
    and unified way to interconnect the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data, and
    applications over the Web. At a high level, the OGC SensorThings API provides
    two main functions and each function is handled by the Sensing part or the Tasking
    part. The Sensing part provides a standard way to manage and retrieve observations
    and metadata from heterogeneous IoT sensor systems. The Tasking part provides
    a standard way for parameterizing - also called tasking - of taskable IoT devices,
    such as individual sensors and actuators, composite consumer / commercial / industrial
    / smart cities in-situ platforms, mobile and wearable devices, or even unmanned
    systems platforms such as drones, satellites, connected and autonomous vehicles,
    etc. This document specifies core of the SensorThings Tasking part.
