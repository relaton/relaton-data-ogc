abstract:
- content: "This Standard defines the structure and content of well-known text strings
    describing coordinate reference systems (CRSs) and coordinate operations between
    coordinate reference systems. It does not prescribe how implementations should
    read or write these strings.\r\nThis Standard provides an updated version of WKT
    representation of coordinate reference systems that follows the provisions of
    ISO 19111:2019 including its amendments 1 and 2. It extends the WKT in OGC document
    12-063r5 (ISO 19162) which was based on ISO 19111:2007 and ISO 19111-2:2009. That
    version consolidated several disparate versions of earlier WKT (so-called WKT1)
    and added the description of coordinate operations. \r\n"
