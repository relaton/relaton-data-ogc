abstract:
- content: "Volume 8 of the CDB standard defines the conceptual model and the methodologies
    that allow the description, and transformation or conversion, of geometric properties
    within a set of spatial reference frames supported by the CDB standard. The CDB
    Spatial Reference Model (SRM) supports an unambiguous specification of the positions,
    directions, and distances associated with spatial information. This document also
    defines algorithms for precise transformation of positions, directions and distances
    among different spatial reference frames. \r\nIn previous versions of the CDB
    standard, this CDB volume was Appendix K in CDB Version 3.2 as submitted to the
    OGC.\r\n"
