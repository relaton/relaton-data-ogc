abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report (ER) describes the work performed by the Participants
    in the Exploitation Platforms Earth Observation Clouds (EOC) Thread of OGC Testbed-14
    in regard to the Application Package (AP).\r\n\r\nThe AP serves as a means to
    convey different kinds of information describing a certain application - often,
    but not necessarily, an Earth Observation data processing algorithm - so that
    different elements of an ecosystem generically known as an Exploitation Platform
    can exchange information among themselves in a standard and interoperable way.
    The AP guarantees that, despite potentially very heterogeneous implementations
    and implementing entities, applications are treated equally. The AP also guarantees
    that the Earth Observation scientist who developed it on the one hand is shielded
    from infrastructure details and heterogeneity and on the other hand benefits from
    the ability to execute the same application on different infrastructure.\r\n\r\nGiven
    its suitability for conveying a Common Operating Picture (COP), in OGC Testbed-13
    the OGC Web Services (OWS) Context standard had been chosen as the basic encoding
    for the Application Package. Despite serious consideration, and while acknowledging
    the advantages of that approach, the consensus among Participants was not to continue
    along this path in Testbed-14 but instead to opt for an AP encoding, consisting
    of a WPS-T (Transactional Web Processing Service (WPS)) DeployProcess message
    encoded in JSON (see Chapter 9 for the rationale). The information model conveyed
    in this manner does not differ significantly from the one that could be conveyed
    using OWS Context, and its main, common features can be briefly listed as:\r\n\r\na
    link to the application execution unit,\r\n\r\na description of the applicationâ€™s
    inputs and outputs,\r\n\r\nlinks to required Earth Observation data catalogues,\r\n\r\nand
    the possibility to pass other auxiliary information.\r\n\r\nAn important difference
    in Testbed-14 with respect to Testbed-13 is that the application execution unit
    is not limited to a Docker container, but can also be a workflow described in
    Common Workflow Language (CWL), something which stems directly from one of the
    Sponsor requirements. Finally, it is important to note that this route does not
    preclude from embedding an OWS Context structure in the enclosing DeployProcess
    document if this is desired.\r\n\r\nStarting from the lessons learned and limitations
    identified in Testbed-13, and embracing the new and changed Sponsor requirements,
    this ER explains the trade-offs, decisions and conclusions taken by the Participants
    throughout the project."
