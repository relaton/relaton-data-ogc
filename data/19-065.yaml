abstract:
- content: "This document describes the OpenFlight Scene Description Database Specification,
    commonly\r\nreferred to as simply “OpenFlight”. OpenFlight is a 3D scene description
    file format that was\r\ncreated and is maintained by Presagis. While OpenFlight
    databases are typically created and edited\r\nusing Presagis software tools, the
    format is widely adopted and as a result, many tools exist\r\nto read and write
    OpenFlight database files.\r\nThe primary audience for this document includes
    software developers whose applications are\r\nintended to read and/or write OpenFlight
    database files. To this end, this document discusses\r\nconcepts incorporated
    in OpenFlight and contains a detailed description of the physical layout\r\nof
    OpenFlight files as represented on disk."
