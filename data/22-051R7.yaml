abstract:
- content: "The Geodetic data Grid eXchange Format (GGXF) is designed to be a single
    file format that may be used\r\nfor a wide range of geodetic applications requiring
    interpolation of regularly gridded data, including (but\r\nnot limited to):\r\n•
    Transformation of latitude and longitude coordinates from one geodetic coordinate
    reference\r\nsystem to another;\r\n• Transformation of gravity-related heights
    from one vertical coordinate reference system to\r\nanother;\r\n• Reduction of
    ellipsoid heights to the geoid, quasi-geoid or a surface of a vertical reference
    frame;\r\nand\r\n• The description of coordinate changes due to deformation.\r\nThe
    GGXF format has been designed specifically for carrying gridded geodetic parameters
    supporting\r\ncoordinate transformations and point motion operations but has no
    restriction on the type of content\r\nthat may be included."
