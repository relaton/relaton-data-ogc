abstract:
- content: This CDB Volume provides terms and definitions. Many of the terms and definitions
    are specific to the simulation industry. Other terms and definitions have been
    updated to be consistent with the ISO 19xxx (Geomatics) series of standards, specifically
    ISO 19111 Spatial referencing by Coordinates and ISO 19017 Spatial Schema. Some
    work still remains to make the terms and definitions completely consistent with
    current OGC and ISO best practice.
