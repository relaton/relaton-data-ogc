abstract:
- content: "Indoor Mapping Data Format (referenced throughout this document as IMDF)
    provides a generalized, yet comprehensive model for any indoor location, providing
    a basis for orientation, navigation and discovery. In this release there are also
    detailed instructions for modeling the spaces of an airport, a shopping mall,
    and a train station.\r\n\r\nThis release also has an extension model which enables
    a venue, organization, or even an industry to create valid features and validations
    not available in the current specification for private or public use\r\n\r\n"
