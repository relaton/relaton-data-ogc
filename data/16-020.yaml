abstract:
- content: "This document is a deliverable of the OGC Testbed 12. It describes the
    results of enhancing the tool ShapeChange in the following areas of processing
    an ISO 19109 conformant application schema:\r\n\r\nCreating a schema profile -
    to support implementations that focus on a subset of the use cases in scope of
    the original application schema.\r\n\r\nDeriving an ontology representation of
    the application schema (using RDF(S)/SKOS/OWL) - to support Semantic Web / Linked
    Data implementations."
