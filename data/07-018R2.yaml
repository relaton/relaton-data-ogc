abstract:
- content: The SPS configuration proposed in this profile is intended to support the
    programming process of Earth Observation (EO) sensors system. This profile describes
    a consistent SPS configuration that can be supported by many satellite data providers,
    most of whom have existing facilities for the management of these programming
    requests.
