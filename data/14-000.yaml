abstract:
- content: "This activity is part of OGC Testbed 10. The aviation thread was focused
    on developing\r\nand demonstrating the use of the Aeronautical Information Exchange
    Model (AIXM) and\r\nthe Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM), building on
    the work accomplished in\r\nprior testbeds to advance the applications of OGC
    Web Services standards in next generation\r\nair traffic management systems to
    support European and US aviation modernization\r\nprograms\r\nThis document summarizes
    technical work relating to the enhancement of the GML 3.2.1\r\nconformance test
    suite in accord with the requirements in the OWS-10 RFQ, Annex B1,\r\nsection
    6.3.6: “GML for Aviation Compliance Test Suite + GML for Aviation Conformance\r\nTesting
    ER”. The essential aim is to advance compliance with respect to the use of\r\nGML
    geometry representations in aviation (AIXM) data."
