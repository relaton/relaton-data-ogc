abstract:
- content: This Engineering Report describes all Testbed-13 activities relating to
    the Climate Data Accessibility for Adaptation Planning requirements of the National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). It discusses relevant experiences
    made during implementation including recommendations to the sponsor, and provides
    resulting standards change requests to the appropriate working groups. Additionally,
    it develops best practices for data and model integration and serves as a guidance
    document to work with NASA Earth Science Data System (ESDS) working groups and
    externally provided data. The added value of this Engineering Report is to improve
    interoperability and to advance location-based technologies and realize innovations
    with regards to NASA Climate Data and NASA ESDS objectives.
