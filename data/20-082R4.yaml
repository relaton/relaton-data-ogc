abstract:
- content: "This document defines a conceptual schema for observations, for features
    involved in the observation process, and for features involved in sampling when
    making observations. These provide models for the exchange of information describing
    observation acts and their results, both within and between different scientific
    and technical communities.\r\n\r\nObservations commonly involve sampling of an
    ultimate feature-of-interest. This document defines a common set of sample types
    according to their spatial, material (for ex situ observations) or statistical
    nature. The schema includes relationships between sample features (sub-sampling,
    derived samples).\r\n\r\nThis document concerns only externally visible interfaces
    and places no restriction on the underlying implementations other than what is
    needed to satisfy the interface specifications in the actual situation."
