abstract:
- content: GeoRSS is designed as a lightweight, community driven way to extend existing
    RSS feeds with simple geographic information. The GeoRSS standard provides for
    encoding location in an interoperable manner so that applications can request,
    aggregate, share and map geographically tag feeds.
