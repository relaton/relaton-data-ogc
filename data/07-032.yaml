abstract:
- content: This document specifies a GML 3.2 Application Schema for frame image geopositioning
    metadata, for XML encoding of the georeferencing coordinate transformation parameters
    of an unrectified frame image. A frame image is one whose entire two-dimensional
    extent was collected at one time. A georeferencing coordinate transformation can
    transform position coordinates between a specific ground-based (or object) Coordinate
    Reference System (CRS) and the image CRS.
