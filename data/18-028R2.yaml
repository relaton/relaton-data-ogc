abstract:
- content: "Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) as they are intended
    and described at the OGC are two related concepts which require very specific
    treatment and characterization. Citing the definitions provided by the Domain
    Working Group (DWG) charter document:\r\n\r\nQuality of Service: Technical reliability
    and performance of a network service. Typically measured using metrics like error
    rates, throughput, availability and delay or request response time. This Engineering
    Report (ER) attempts to handle QoS aspects such as service availability, scalability
    and speed.\r\n\r\nQuality of (User) Experience: A holistic, qualitative measure
    of the customers' experience of the application or service. It encompasses both
    the user experience and the customer support experience of the evaluated applications
    and/or services.\r\n\r\nQoE focuses on the usability of the information that is
    conceived via OGC services to end users or other client application and therefore
    is concerned more with qualitative aspects of such services like presence of metadata,
    proper and descriptive namings, appropriate styling and so on (a more thorough
    treatment is present in the QoE discussion paper OGC 17-049 entitled Ensuring
    Quality of User Experience with OGC Web Mapping Services available at https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=74403&version=1).\r\n\r\nQoS
    focuses on providing reliable (i.e. quantitative ) measures of spatial data service
    metrics which can be used to characterize how a service ( one or more specific
    datasets exposed by a certain service) is performing both in near real-time as
    well as historically. It touches concepts like availability, scalability (also
    known as capacity), absolute performance (i.e. speed) and can be used to assess
    also perceived performance by final clients. As mentioned above, it is typically
    measured using metrics like error rates, throughput, availability and delay or
    request response time.\r\n\r\nQuite often the QoS and QoE aspects of spatial data
    services are underestimated if not simply ignored due to lack of resources as
    well as lack of awareness, resulting in services which are difficult to exploit
    (i.e. QoE very low) and/or unstable or very slow (i.e. QoS very low). The result
    is that few users end up using them after the initial launch and this is especially
    true for services targeting end users who are used to interact with services a-la
    Google Maps which delivers extreme performance and scalability as well as bullet-proof
    usability.\r\n\r\n"
