abstract:
- content: The purpose of this report is to recommend appropriate architectures and
    procedures for migrating the CUAHSI HIS to the OGC-based WaterML 2.0 encoding
    (profile of OGC O&M standard) and OGC web services such as Sensor Observation
    Service (SOS), Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Mapping Service (WMS), Web Coverage
    Service (WCS), and Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW). This report may be used
    as the basis for future OGC Interoperability Program initiatives.
