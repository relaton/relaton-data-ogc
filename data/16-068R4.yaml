- content: "This OGC Testbed 12 Engineering Report discusses the topic of vector tiling.\r\n\r\nWhile
    tiling and the use of multiple levels of details are a proven technique for raster
    data, it is relatively new for vector data. This is due to the increased complexity
    for tiling vector data compared to raster tiling. Further, there is a lack of
    standardization on the topic. Yet vector tiles can provide the same benefits as
    for raster tiles:\r\n\r\nServices can easily cache tiles and return them upon
    request, without the need for any additional pre/post processing (assuming no
    geometry construction is needed in the server). Consequently, clients can request
    and receive tiles quickly, ensuring better user experience.\r\n\r\nDue to tiled,
    multileveled data representations, clients can better access the data most suitable
    for their current map location and scale. This avoids the need to load too much
    data, which can cause both excessive memory usage and network traffic resulting
    in reduced overall performance.\r\n\r\nAn example of vector tiling that illustrates
    the impact of these benefits is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) data store, which includes
    over 30 GB of data with worldwide coverage consisting of millions of vector features.
    Loading and visualizing all the OSM data into an application would either result
    in a memory shortage or unacceptable performance. By means of vector tiling and
    the generation of multiple levels of detail, apps using OSM data can load such
    data sets very efficiently into applications.\r\n\r\nThis Engineering Report (ER)
    focuses on the general aspects of vector tiling. One of the main goals is to characterize
    what vector tiling is and how it can be approached. Highlighted topics include
    tiling approaches and strategies, tiling schemes, data coherence, simplification,
    scalability and styling. With respect to tiling schemes, existing standards material
    related to raster tiling schemes is incorporated to align both topics and to maximize
    interoperability. This includes the Defence Geospatial Information Working Group
    (DGIWG) Web Map Tiling Standard (WMTS) profile and the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence
    (NSG) WMTS profile as defined by the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
    (NGA).\r\n\r\nThe topic of implementing vector tiles using a tile encoding / storage
    format is not covered. A study of implementing vector tiles in OGC GeoPackage
    is part of a separate Engineering Report, OGC 16-067, that builds on the results
    of this ER.\r\n\r\n"
