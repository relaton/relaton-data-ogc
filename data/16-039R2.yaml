abstract:
- content: "This engineering report examines the role of geospatial semantic technology
    in the domain of civil aviation. Many aeronautical services (providing information
    on request or processing the data) are based on OGC Web Service specifications.
    A number of aeronautical services possess geospatial attributes. The aviation
    services follow OWS Common Service requirements but also have domain specific
    capabilities. Services metadata is often very relevant for service consumption,
    especially in the SOA environment of aviationâ€™s System Wide Information Management
    (SWIM). Therefore, it shall be exposed to consumer stakeholders for either design
    or runtime service discovery in an efficient, standardized way.\r\n\r\nThis ER
    starts introducing the WSDOM service ontology developed by FAA for semantic service
    discovery. It proposes several extensions useful for OWS compatible, geospatial
    aviation services. It combines GeoSPARQL with WSDOM ontology and FAA service classification
    taxonomies and elaborates the interoperability between ontology based WSDOM and
    OWS compatible service descriptions."
