abstract:
- content: "This OGC Engineering Report (ER) describes the results of experiments
    in OGC Testbed 12 designed to potentially enhance capabilities for symbology and
    routing [1] as extensions to the OGC GeoPackage standard. These experiments focused
    on 1.) methods for providing mounted and/or dismounted (off-road) routing within
    GeoPackage and 2.) mechanisms for providing user-defined map symbology for features
    in a GeoPackage structured data store. This ER documents the different approaches
    considered, design decisions and rationales, limitations, and issues encountered
    during prototype implementation.\r\n\r\n"
