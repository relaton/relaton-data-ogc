abstract:
- content: This document proposes a set of best practices and guidelines for implementing
    and using the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Map Service (WMS) to serve
    maps which are time-dependent or elevation-dependent. In particular, clarifications
    and restrictions on the use of WMS are defined to allow unambiguous and safe interoperability
    between clients and servers, in the context of expert meteorological and oceanographic
    usage and non-expert usage in other communities. This Best Practice document applies
    specifically to WMS version 1.3, but many of the concepts and recommendations
    will be applicable to other versions of WMS or to other OGC services, such as
    the Web Coverage Service.
