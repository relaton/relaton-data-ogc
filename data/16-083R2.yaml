abstract:
- content: "The OGC GML Application Schema - Coverages (“GMLCOV”) version 1.0 [OGC
    09-146r2], recently renamed the OGC Coverage Implementation Schema version 1.0,
    provides a ReferenceableGridCoverage element for representing coverages on a referenceable
    grid.  However, GMLCOV provides no instantiable subtypes of a critical sub-element
    of ReferenceableGridCoverage, GMLCOV::AbstractReferenceableGrid.  To make use
    of ReferenceableGridCoverage, an extension deriving from GMLCOV would need to
    be developed.  GML 3.3 is not such an extension of GMLCOV, as it is built independently
    from GMLCOV.  Use of the instantiable referenceable grid elements of GML 3.3 with
    ReferenceableGridCoverage violates Requirement 14 of GMLCOV 1.0 and Requirement
    24 of the OGC Modular Specification[1].\r\n\r\nThis OGC Coverage Implementation
    Schema - ReferenceableGridCoverage Extension provides a set of referenceable grid
    elements for use as sub-elements of ReferenceableGridCoverage.  Three of these
    elements have been adapted from GML 3.3, while a fourth emerged from work on a
    Testbed-11 Engineering Report[2]."
