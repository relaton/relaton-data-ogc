abstract:
- content: "This OGC Testbed-16 Engineering Report (ER) evaluates the suitability
    of existing OGC standards for the generation of Moving Features from Full Motion
    Video (FMV) that has an embedded stream of detected moving objects.\r\n\r\nThis
    ER presents several proof of concept applications that accept FMVs, with multiple
    encoded Video Moving Target Indicators (VMTI), and combines the VMTIs into separate
    tracks that are then encoded to OGC Moving Features.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the ER
    explores the generation of records encoded according to OGC Sensor Model Language
    (SensorML) 2.0 standard describing the collection platform and relevant telemetry
    information from the key-value stream content encoded according to the MISB 0601
    and 0903 specifications of the Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB)."
