abstract:
- content: The OGC Testbed-17 Moving Features (MF) task addressed the exchange of
    moving object detections, shared processing of detections for correlation and
    analysis, and visualization of moving objects within common operational pictures.
    This Engineering Report (ER) explores and describes an architecture for collaborative
    distributed object detection and analysis of multi-source motion imagery, supported
    by OGC MF standards. The ER presents the proposed architecture, identifies the
    necessary standards, describes all developed components, reports on the results
    of all TIE activities, and provides a description of recommended future work items.
