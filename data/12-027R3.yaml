abstract:
- content: "This OGC discussion paper provides a proposal for a temporality extension
    for the WFS\r\n2.0 and FES 2.0 standard. It is based on the work of and experiences
    made in several\r\nOWS test beds, in particular OWS-7, OWS-8 and OWS-9, Aviation
    threads and\r\ndiscussions at the 2011 OGC TC meeting in Brussels, Belgium. It
    partially replaces and\r\nadvances the document “OWS-8 Aviation: Guidance for
    Retrieving AIXM 5.1 data via\r\nan OGC WFS 2.0” [4]."
