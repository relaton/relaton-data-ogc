abstract:
- content: "Mixed Reality (MR), also referred to as hybrid reality, is the merging
    of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where
    physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time. MR has great
    potential in enhancing situation awareness and otherwise augmenting the experiences
    and performance of humans on the go.\r\n\r\nThis OGC Engineering Report summarizes
    information and findings collected during the Mixed Reality at the Edge Concept
    Development Study (CDS). Specifically, this report presents the significant findings
    concerning the state-of-the-art and potential of employing MR in modern systems,
    with a focus on discussing the state of needed interoperability and standards.\r\n\r\nThe
    term mixed reality was originally introduced in a 1994 paper by Paul Milgram and
    Fumio Kishino, A Taxonomy of Mixed Reality Visual Displays. What is mixed reality?."
