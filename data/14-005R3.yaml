abstract:
- content: This OGC速 IndoorGML standard specifies an open data model and XML schema
    for indoor spatial information. IndoorGML is an application schema of OGC速 GML
    3.2.1. While there are several 3D building modelling standards such as CityGML,
    KML, and IFC, which deal with interior space of buildings from geometric, cartographic,
    and semantic viewpoints, IndoorGML intentionally focuses on modelling indoor spaces
    for navigation purposes.
