abstract:
- content: This engineering report captures use cases representative of the vision
    of the Arctic Spatial Data Infrastructure (ArcticSDI). The ArcticSDI is a cooperative
    initiative established between the eight National Mapping Agencies of Canada,
    Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, USA and Denmark, with the aim of providing
    governments, policy makers, scientists, private enterprises and citizens in the
    Arctic with access to geographically related Arctic data, digital maps, and tools
    to facilitate monitoring and decision-making. The initiative will achieve this
    aim by providing a framework of spatial information resources, organizational
    structures, technologies of creation, processing and exchange of spatial data,
    that provides broad access and efficient use of spatial data for the Arctic. The
    engineering report provides a review of the policy drivers supporting the establishment
    of spatial data infrastructure (SDI) in each Arctic nation in order to improve
    understanding of the use cases, user groups and the impact an ArcticSDI may have
    on their day-to-day business. The engineering report presents lessons learnt along
    each of the components of SDI, for example, users, data, technology, standards,
    policy and others. A discussion is presented on how the technologies and standards
    already in use by the national mapping agencies relate to the technologies and
    standards implemented by the testbed, as well as how emerging geospatial standards
    could benefit the ArcticSDI.
