abstract:
- content: This Engineering Report (ER) summarizes the findings and recommendations
    for building an information registry working together with the existing Federal
    Aviation Administration (FAA) System Wide Information Management (SWIM) aviation
    service registries, the National Airspace System Service Registry and Repository
    (NSRR). This information registry should allow the different Air Traffic Management
    (ATM) stakeholders to retrieve the appropriate service registered in the NSRR
    using the semantic representation of real-life entities represented by the data
    served by the services (e.g. estimated departure time, estimated time of arrival,
    ”runway true bearing”…). To support the integration of this domain-specific information,
    the ER proposes different strategies based on the semantic annotation proposal
    made in OGC 08-167r2 [1] extended with a recent World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
    recommendation, the Web Annotation data model [1]. In particular, the ER focuses
    on a solution using the W3C web annotation data model which adds semantics to
    the NSRR without changing the content of the database. This solution provides
    a low-cost, flexible and efficient alternative to add domain-specific semantics
    to NSRR content. The ER concludes with remarks on the elements necessary for implementing
    the information registry as a web annotation store as well as the necessity to
    build domain-specific knowledge models to support further interoperability and
    further service discoverability and the added-values of using the Data Catalog
    (DCAT) or Semantic Registry Information Model (SRIM) to better describe and retrieve
    ATM services.
