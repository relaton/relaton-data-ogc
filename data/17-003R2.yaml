abstract:
- content: "JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [NR1] has been gaining in popularity
    for encoding data in Web-based applications. JSON consists of sets of objects
    described by name/value pairs.  This OGC standard describes a GeoJSON [NR2] and
    JSON-LD [NR3] encoding for Earth Observation (EO) metadata for datasets (granules).
    \ This standard can be applied to encode metadata based on the Earth Observation
    Metadata Profile of Observations and Measurements (O&M) OGC 10-157r4 [OR1] or
    as an encoding of the Unified Metadata Model for Granules (UMM-G) conceptual model
    [OR2].\r\n\r\nThe GeoJSON encoding defined in this document is defined as a compaction[1]
    through a normative context, of the proposed JSON-LD encoding, with some extensions
    as presented in section 8 of this document.  Therefore, the JSON-LD encoding can
    also be applied to other RDF [OR8] encodings including RDF XML [OR11] and RDF
    Turtle [OR12].\r\n\r\nThis document makes no assumptions as to the “service” interfaces
    through which the metadata are accessed and applies equally well to a Service
    Oriented Architecture as well as a Resource Oriented or RESTful Architecture.
    \ The documented approach can be applied in combination with the following technologies:\r\n\r\nOGC
    OpenSearch extensions [OR19], [OR20], [OR25],\r\nW3C Linked Data Platform [OR21],
    [OR22],\r\nOASIS searchRetrieve [OR23],\r\nOASIS OData [OR24].\r\nGeoJSON is a
    format for encoding collections of simple geographical features along with their
    non-spatial attributes using JSON. GeoJSON objects may represent a geometry, a
    feature, or a collection of features. GeoJSON supports the following geometry
    types derived from the OGC Simple Features specification: Point, LineString, Polygon,
    MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon and GeometryCollection. Features in
    GeoJSON contain a geometry object and additional properties, and a feature collection
    represents a list of features.\r\n\r\nJSON is human readable and easily parseable.
    However, JSON is schemaless.  JSON and GeoJSON documents do not include an explicit
    definition of the structure of the JSON objects contained in them.  Therefore,
    this standard is based on a normative JSON-LD context which allows each property
    to be explicitly defined as a URI.  Furthermore, the JSON encoding is defined
    using JSON Schema [OR18] which allows validation of instances against these schemas."
