abstract:
- content: Routing is one of the most widely used functions of mobile applications.
    Routing often requires consideration of a variety of factors in order to provide
    reasonable estimations of journey time and the cost of travel. Another widely
    used function of mobile applications is the visualization of characteristics of
    terrain such as slope or viewsheds. The goal of this engineering report is to
    describe the work carried out in the OGC Testbed-11 for multidimensional terrain
    and routing support on SQLite databases that conform to the OGC GeoPackage standard.
    This OGC® Engineering Report (ER) describes an approach for the storage of routing
    and multidimensional terrain data in such databases. The ER also presents the
    results and lessons learnt from the experimentation conducted by the testbed.
