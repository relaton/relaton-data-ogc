abstract:
- content: "This document defines Moving Features Access, i.e., access methods to
    moving feature data for retrieving feature attributes, information on a relation
    between a trajectory object and one or more geometry objects, and information
    on a relation between two trajectory objects from a database storing trajectory
    data of moving features.\r\n\r\nAbstract methods of accessing moving features
    data are defined in ISO 19141:2008 (Geographic information - Schema for moving
    features) [ISO 19141:2008]. However, the methods are insufficient to access a
    database storing moving feature data from multiple sources. If implementations
    for access to moving features data using various programming languages or protocols
    (e.g., SQL, Java, and HTTP) are developed without any standards, these implementations
    might be inconsistent with each other, resulting in poor interoperability. Therefore,
    methods to access a database storing moving feature data are necessary to improve
    interoperability.\r\n\r\nApplications using moving feature data, typically representing
    vehicles or pedestrians, are rapidly increasing. Innovative applications are expected
    to require the overlay and integration of moving feature data from different sources
    to create greater social and business value. Moreover, systems relying on single-source
    moving feature data are now evolving into more integrated systems. Integration
    of moving feature data from different sources is a key to developing more innovative
    and advanced applications.\r\n\r\nMoving Features Access ensures better data exchange
    by handling and integrating moving feature data to broaden the market for geo-spatial
    information such as Geospatial Big Data Analysis. OGC 14-083r2 (OGC® Moving Features
    Encoding Part I: XML Core) [OGC 14-083r2] and OGC 14-084r2 (OGC® Moving Features
    Encoding Extension: Simple Comma Separated Values (CSV)) [OGC 14-084r2] are existing
    implementation standards. Moving Features Access uses these standards to encode
    moving features."
