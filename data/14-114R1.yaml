abstract:
- content: "Part 1 of WaterML2.0 covers exchange of hydrological time-series data,
    the observational processes used to generate them, and information related to
    the monitoring points (stations/sites) where time-series data are typically collected.
    WaterML2.0 Part 2, is a candidate standard that defines how to exchange rating
    tables, gauging observations and cross-sections in an interoperable manner. \r\nThis
    engineering report outlines the design and results of an OGC Interoperability
    Experiment (IE) that implemented and tested the current WaterML2.0 part 2 information
    model. The OGC IE experiment ran was conducted from November 2013 to August 2014.
    The use case for the IE involved exchange of data in three scenarios in Australia,
    US and the UK. \r\nThis report describes the software requirements, design, deployments
    and challenges faced by the experiment. The results were used to improve the WaterML2.0
    part 2 information model and provided the basis for the formation of an OGC Standards
    Working Group (SWG) in August 2014. This SWG is responsible for formalization
    of the candidate OGC standard, for submission in 2015. \r\n"
