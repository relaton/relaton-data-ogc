abstract:
- content: "The Web Feature Service (WFS) represents a change in the way geographic
    information is created, modified and exchanged on the Internet. Rather than sharing
    geographic information at the file level using File Transfer Protocol (FTP), for
    example, the WFS offers direct fine-grained access to geographic information at
    the feature and feature property level.\r\n\r\nThis International Standard specifies
    discovery operations, query operations, locking operations, transaction operations
    and operations to manage stored, parameterized query expressions.\r\n\r\nDiscovery
    operations allow the service to be interrogated to determine its capabilities
    and to retrieve the application schema that defines the feature types that the
    service offers.\r\n\r\nQuery operations allow features or values of feature properties
    to be retrieved from the underlying data store based upon constraints, defined
    by the client, on feature properties.\r\n\r\nLocking operations allow exclusive
    access to features for the purpose of modifying or deleting features.\r\n\r\nTransaction
    operations allow features to be created, changed, replaced and deleted from the
    underlying data store.\r\n\r\nStored query operations allow clients to create,
    drop, list and described parameterized query expressions that are stored by the
    server and can be repeatedly invoked using different parameter values.\r\n\r\nThis
    International Standard defines eleven operations:\r\n\r\nGetCapabilities (discovery
    operation)\r\nDescribeFeatureType (discovery operation)\r\nGetPropertyValue (query
    operation)\r\nGetFeature (query operation)\r\nGetFeatureWithLock (query & locking
    operation)\r\nLockFeature (locking operation)\r\nTransaction (transaction operation)\r\nCreateStoredQuery
    (stored query operation)\r\nDropStoredQuery (stored query operation)\r\nListStoredQueries
    (stored query operation)\r\nDescribeStoredQueries (stored query operation)\r\nIn
    the taxonomy of services defined in ISO 19119, the WFS is primarily a feature
    access service but also includes elements of a feature type service, a coordinate
    conversion/transformation service and geographic format conversion service."
