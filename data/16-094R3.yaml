abstract:
- content: his OGC Engineering Report (ER) describes the setup, experiments, results
    and issues generated by the GeoPackage Elevation Extension Interoperability Experiment
    (GPKG-EE IE). The goal of the GPKG-EE IE was to implement and test a proposed
    elevation extension to the OGC GeoPackage Encoding Standard (12-128r1).  The proposed
    elevation extension was successfully implemented by several IE participants and
    was demonstrated using both 2-Dimensional (2D) and 3-Dimensional (3D) software
    clients at the Washington, DC OGC Technical Committee (TC) meeting in [March 9,
    2016].  This ER concludes with several recommendations for addressing remaining
    technical issues that must be resolved in order to complete a candidate GeoPackage
    Elevation Extension standard.
