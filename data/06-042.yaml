abstract:
- content: 'The OpenGISÂ® Web Map Service Interface Standard (WMS) provides a simple
    HTTP interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed
    geospatial databases. A WMS request defines the geographic layer(s) and area of
    interest to be processed. The response to the request is one or more geo-registered
    map images (returned as JPEG, PNG, etc) that can be displayed in a browser application.
    The interface also supports the ability to specify whether the returned images
    should be transparent so that layers from multiple servers can be combined or
    not. <p>NOTE: WMS 1.3 and ISO 19128 are the same documents.'
