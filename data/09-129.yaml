abstract:
- content: This AIP-2 Engineering Report (ER) describes a set of transverse technology
    Use Cases developed and applied in the GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot
    Phase 2 (AIP-2).  Such Use Cases define reusable activities within a service-oriented
    architecture, tailored for the GEOSS environment.  This report contains the general
    Use Cases that were specialized by community Working Groups to implement several
    specific Societal Benefit Area (SBA) Scenarios in AIP-2.  The SBA Scenarios and
    specialized use cases are defined in separate AIP-2 ERs. This AIP-2 ER will be
    offered for consideration by the GEOSS Best Practice Registry editors and to OGC
    Technical Committee for consideration as a Best Practice.
