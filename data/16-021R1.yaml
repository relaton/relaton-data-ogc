abstract:
- content: 'For delivering of data that is offered by OGC services over (very) low
    bandwidth, two options may be considered: On the one hand, the geospatial features
    remain the same, but compression techniques are used to reduce the size of the
    data that needs to be transferred. On the other hand, generalization techniques
    may be used by reducing the details of geometries and/or attributes in order to
    reduce the amount of data. The aim of this ER is to summarize the results of implementing
    sample services using compression techniques for DGIWG WFS (U002) and providing
    generalization processes using WPS (U003). The ER compares the results of the
    different approaches and infers recommendations and best practices for supporting
    data delivery of standard data and complex 3D data from OGC services over low
    and very low bandwidth.'
