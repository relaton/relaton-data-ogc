abstract:
- content: This OGC® document gives guidelines for enabling interoperability among
    different hydro data models and services. The demonstration specifically gives
    out best practices for supporting interoperability among the National Hydrographic
    Network (NHN) of Canada, the National Hydrographic Dataset Plus (NHD+) of United
    States, and the OGC HY_Features model developed and proposed by the World Meteorological
    Organization (WMO). The discussed version of OGC HY_Features was adopted as the
    mediation bridge model to exchange information among heterogeneous hydrological
    models.
