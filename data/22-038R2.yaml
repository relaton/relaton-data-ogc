abstract:
- content: Currently, most OGC standards focus on data that is observed on the ground
    or directly above planet Earth. Other standards, such as GeoSciML, provide a data
    model and transfer standard for geological data. Other projects have considered
    data models and exchange standards for the seas and oceans. Extra-terrestrial
    space and the exact location of remote spaceborne sensors has been less in focus.
    This OGC Testbed 18 Engineering Report (ER) starts with an evaluation of current
    standards and then proposes changes or extensions to those standards in order
    to describe objects in orbit around any celestial body or in free flight in our
    solar system with respect to their location, trajectory, and orientation. Finally
    standard-based mechanisms to transform a location within a reference frame to
    a location within another reference frame are examined.
