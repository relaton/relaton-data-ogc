abstract:
- content: "The goal of the Geo4NIEM thread in Testbed 11 was to gain Intelligence
    Community (IC) concurrence of the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) Version
    3.0 architecture through the development, implementations, test, and robust demonstration
    making use of IC specifications, Geography Markup Language (GML), and NIEM in
    a simulated “real-world” scenario. The demonstration scenario begins with NIEM-conformant
    Information Exchange Packages (IEPs) containing operational data and IC security
    tags from the Information Security Marking (ISM) and Need-To-Know (NTK) access
    control metadata, and the Trusted Data Format (TDF) for binding assertion metadata
    with data resource(s). Those instance documents are deployed on Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) Web Services to be used by client applications. Access control
    is based on attributes of the end-user and the instance data.  \r\nThe assessment
    included reviewing example IEPDs and performing test and demonstrations using
    OGC web services, such as Transactional Web Feature Services (WFS-T), Policy Enforcement
    Points (PEPs) and OGC Attribute Stores to process geographic feature with NIEM
    components and security tags. The Test and Demonstration included, but was not
    limited to feature retrieval and transactions. Recommendations to update these
    information exchanges were provided to reflect NIEM 3.0 architecture and security
    tags in a ‘NIEM/IC Feature Processing API’. Results from this task helped provide
    a preliminary architecture for Geo4NIEM in Testbed 11, summarized in other OGC
    Testbed 11 Engineering Reports.  \r\nThis task also identified potential change
    requests to OGC WFS or other OGC Services for handling security information in
    a federated role-based access control environment. These changes may help the
    NIEM/IC transform into more agile and customer-centric frameworks driven by collaborative
    partnerships. This transformation is vital to confronting the security challenges
    of the future.\r\n"
