abstract:
- content: "Historically, conceptual modeling was utilized sporadically within the
    Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Models were used in OGC standards both informatively
    and normatively to describe the structure of the information within a standard
    for a particular domain. As independent standards-development organizations, OGC
    and alliance partners such as ISO / TC211 did not always develop common models.
    There are several examples of conceptual models in OGC’s Abstract Specifications,
    many of which have become ISO / TC211 standards since their publication. Outside
    of Abstract Specifications, there are fewer examples of conceptual models in Implementation
    Standards. Logical Models and Physical Models tend to be specified more in Implementation
    Standards.\r\n\r\nThe need for conceptual models in Implementation Standards has
    become apparent since the OGC is moving towards resource based architecture through
    the development of the OGC Application Programming Interface (API) suite of standards.
    In the previous ways of working, standards and encodings mapped 1:1, as many OGC
    standards were based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and a standard described
    a particular set of XML documents to support a domain. The move to OGC API has
    led towards a separation of an information model represented in a standard from
    encodings, which is the way that the information models are expressed in a given
    technology. In other words, the move to OGC API has led to a clearer separation
    of the logical model from the physical model.\r\n\r\nThe utilization of conceptual
    modeling practices may be employed to manage, track, or govern the use of concepts
    and terms within different standards. The OGC should adopt conceptual modeling
    where suitable with a new group to support the working groups with the modeling
    effort that may otherwise have not been completed because a lack of expertise
    or value recognition. Taking the concept one step further, Model Driven Architecture
    (MDA) is a transformation process to create a platform specific model, or implementation
    from a logical, platform-independent model. This process could be implemented
    to enable quick production of standards into different target technologies or
    for the creation of new standards entirely. This paper does not suggest making
    MDA and associated mandatory for future standards generation."
