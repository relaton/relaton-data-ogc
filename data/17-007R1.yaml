abstract:
- content: "This standard applies to a deployed OGC Web Service instance for which
    the protocol scheme of all operation endpoint URLs, exposed in the Capabilities
    document, is ‘https’ as defined in RFC 7230, section 2.7.2.\r\n\r\nA security-annotated
    Capabilities document is one which uses the <Constraint> element(s) to express
    the existence of security controls on the operation of the service instance or
    support for a particular security feature. Applying the tests as defined in the
    Annexes can validate compliance for a service, the client and the OGC management
    process. Basically, a service can be described by a Capabilities document that
    includes security annotations as defined in this standard. A client loading these
    Capabilities and parse for the <Constraint> element(s) can determine the security
    controls implemented for each operation of the service instance. The string value
    of this element’s name attribute contains the identifier of the implemented requirements
    class.\r\n\r\nHow the client obtains the security-annotated capabilities is out
    of scope for this standard.\r\n\r\nThis standard defines one common abstract Requirements
    Class and three Capabilities document structure specific Requirements Classes.
    The structure specific classes address how the requirements are implemented for
    WMS 1.1.1, WMS 1.3 and OWS Common based service Capabilities documents.\r\n\r\n"
