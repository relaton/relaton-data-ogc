abstract:
- content: This standard defines a conceptual Geospatial User Feedback (GUF) data
    model. Geospatial User Feedback is metadata that is predominantly produced by
    the consumers of geospatial data products as they use and gain experience with
    those products. This standard complements existing metadata conventions whereby
    documents recording dataset characteristics and production workflows are generated
    by the creator, publisher or curator of a data product. As a part of metadata,
    the GUF data model reuses some elements of ISO 19115-1:2014 (the updated version
    of the OGC Abstract Specification Topic 11) but not the general structure. This
    selective use of ISO metadata elements prioritizes future interoperability with
    developing ISO metadata models. This standard is designed to be used combination
    with an encoding standard. Initially an XML encoding following the ISO 19139 encoding
    rules is specified in a separate OGC implementation standard (OGC 15-098). In
    the future other encodings may be defined, including examples such as the use
    of JSON-LD based on parts of schema.org.
