abstract:
- content: This document defines a basic SensorML profile for discovery purposes.
    Besides a minimum set of metadata also the structure of according SensorML documents
    is defined in order to ensure a consistent metadata description. This goal is
    achieved by a set of Schematron rules that can be used to validate if a given
    SensorML document complies with the profile described in this engineering report.
