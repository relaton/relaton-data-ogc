abstract:
- content: This Engineering Report (ER) summarizes the OGC Testbed-14 findings and
    recommendations to “semantically enable” existing data and metadata models used
    in the aviation industry. Examples of such data and metadata models include Aeronautical
    Information Exchange Model (AIXM) [1], Weather Information Exchange Model (WXXM)
    [2], Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM) [3],Web Service Description Document
    (WSDD), Service Description Conceptual Model (SDCM) [4]). These models use Linked
    Data standards to represent this information and aim to improve the search and
    discovery of services and information in the aviation domain using the System
    Wide Information Management (SWIM) environment. This report provides a review
    of the existing data models and explore different approaches to provide a semantic
    representation of the current metadata and data models used in the aviation domain.
    The ER also discusses the role and importance of the controlled vocabularies.
