abstract:
- content: "This Engineering Report (ER) addresses the development of a consistent,
    flexible, adaptable workflow that will run behind the scenes. A user should be
    able to discover existing workflows via a catalog and execute them using their
    own datasets. An expert should be able to create workflows and to publish them.
    Previous OGC Testbed initiatives investigated workflows in the geospatial domain:\r\n\r\nOWS
    3 Imagery Workflow Experiments\r\n\r\nOWS 4 WPS IPR Workflow descriptions and
    lessons learned\r\n\r\nOWS 4 Topology Quality Assessment Interoperability Program
    Report\r\n\r\nOWS 5 Data View Architecture Engineering Report\r\n\r\nOWS 6 Geoprocessing
    Workflow Architecture Engineering Report\r\n\r\nThese initiatives mostly favored
    Business Processing Execution Language (BPEL) as the workflow execution language.
    More recent studies ([6], [7]) were performed using BPMN as a means for describing
    and executing workflows comprised of OGC Web services. This ER will give an overview
    about existing approaches to compose and execute geospatial workflows and will
    describe the approach taken in Testbed-13, taking into account security aspects."
