abstract:
- content: "*RETIRED* The objective of this document is to provide a vendor-neutral
    interoperable framework that enables collaborating communities to rapidly and
    collaboratively publish, discover, integrate and use geospatial information concerned
    with the protection of critical infrastructure systems in a range of sectors.
    Specifically, this document specifies a Computational Architecture viewpoint for
    a Critical Infrastructure Collaborative Environment (CICE)."
