abstract:
- content: "This position paper is aimed at city officials and domain professionals
    working in an urban data context. Its goal is to clarify the concept of Urban
    Digital Twins (UDT) and to position it in regards of Digital Twins in general
    as well as the emerging Metaverse. \r\n\r\nOverall, the UDT concept is an approach
    to understand characteristics and processes of the built environment at the scale
    of a city. Between climate change and various demographics, dynamic cities are
    facing challenges that are becoming more complex to solve. Most of the time solutions
    have to be imagined with a system of systems approach and cannot be solved in
    silos.\r\n\r\nThe paper represents the current state of the discussion about UDTs
    in the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), a geospatial community and standards
    organization. \r\n\r\nAround 3 use cases, climate change adaptation, urban transformation,
    and urban air mobility, this paper identifies benefits of using a UDT and explain
    the role of Geospatial Information (GI) and how it can contribute to an UDT.\r\n\r\nUDTs
    is a digital representation of the city where elected representatives and professional
    stakeholders can access and contribute to a common reference model to collaborate,
    achieving positive outcomes for the citizens. UDTs reveal insights at the intersection
    of the natural and built environments and human activities. They provide the means
    of enabling simulation scenarios and plan possible interventions as well as tracking
    measurable evidence of any changes in the real world. In a mature state, UDTs
    will establish effective feedback loops between the virtual and the true, physical
    environments.   \r\n\r\nFrom discussions with elected representatives, professionals,
    and also based on OGC member experience on projects, it is acknowledged that the
    process of building an UDT might seem daunting (as outlined in the paper by [Lei,
    2023]:  Challenges of urban digital twins: A systematic review and a Delphi expert
    survey).\r\n\r\nThis paper presents a pragmatic approach based on OGC standards
    for each use case, building on location and GI as the foundation. This approach
    calls for an effective data strategy and suggests that a project-based approach
    with a vision of building a UDT is the most efficient path.\r\n\r\nThis concept
    of UDT, although often mentioned in the media, is still fairly new in practice
    and the governance of that type of platform is still a challenge. OGC is keen
    on supporting and collaborating on projects to help create the best practices
    on that matter."
