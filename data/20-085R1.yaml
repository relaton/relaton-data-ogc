- content: "The objectives of this MS&G\r\nTechnical Paper are focused on identifying
    technology trends\r\nthat are influencing the convergence of GEOINT and M&S\r\ntradecraft.
    The purpose is to advance ideas and techniques,\r\nsuch as reality modeling of
    3D environments, which increase\r\nthe knowledge-base and capacity of the geospatial
    analyst\r\ncommunity writ large."
