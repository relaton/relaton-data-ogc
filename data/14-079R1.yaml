abstract:
- content: "The USGS Interoperability assessment was conducted under the OGC Interoperability\r\nProgram
    with the goal to better understand how USGS customers make use of OGC\r\ncompliant
    Web services operated by USGS. For this assessment, USGS customers have\r\nbeen
    invited to share their experiences and to describe their use cases and experiences\r\nmade
    with USGS data services and products. From those descriptions, recommendations\r\nhave
    been derived that help USGS to better understand their user community and\r\noptimize
    their service offerings."
